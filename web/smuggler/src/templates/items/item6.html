            Today's center of focus. Well, I sure hope not, anyway. Ever since water became scarce across the galaxy, the solid stuff might as well be used as money.
            Who can live without water? Who would like more water? Big questions with big payoffs.<br><br>
            Black market handlers of this stuff are either wannabe criminals looking for a quick way to prison or legendary ice pirates - no inbetweens. And I'm looking more like the former.<br>
            <br>
            You'd think in a world this big, there's gotta be at least one planet loaded with water, right? I'm not going to go looking, though.<br>
            I've learned to stop asking questions a long time ago
