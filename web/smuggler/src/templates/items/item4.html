            I remember doing this since I was a kid. Someone's always got something to hide, something to move, or something to steal. <br>
            Fellas like us get the job done for them. Often no questions asked - its bad for business.
            <br> <br> <br> <br>Vets in the trade always say they never peek at the goods, even though they figure it out without opening 'em.<br><br>
            I'd say the hardest part's seeing the riches you will never afford, but always have in reach. Like this beauty. <br><br>

            At least dreams are free.
