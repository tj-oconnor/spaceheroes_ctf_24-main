# COMMS-ARRAY


## Problem description:

We figured out our rocket's communication array doesn't acknowledge valid messages over a certain size. Can you help figure out what's going on?

## Proctor's guide:

To start the challenge, install `python3` and `socat` as in:

```bash
apt update -y
apt install -y python3 socat
```

Then you can run the challenge with the helper script: `./start.sh`.

If you wish to modify the flag or the port, edit `flag.txt` and `start.sh` respectively.
