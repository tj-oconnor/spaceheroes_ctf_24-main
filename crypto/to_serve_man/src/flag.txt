Ingredients:

- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon of fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 teaspoon of thyme
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- ½ teaspoon of lemon zest
- 1 cup of red wine (for marination)
- 4 potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 3 carrots, roughly chunked
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 cups of human blood (for basting)
- 2 pounds of human meat, carefully sourced
- 1 flag: shctf{fR0m_du57_tO_d3s5eRt}
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

- Prepare the Marinade:
  - In a large bowl, combine minced garlic, chopped rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, lemon zest, and olive oil.
  - Add the human meat to the marinade, ensuring it is well-coated.
  - Pour in the red wine, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for the flavors to meld.

- Preheat the Oven:
  - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

- Prepare the Roast:
  - Remove the marinated human meat from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature.
  - Place the meat in a roasting pan, surrounded by potatoes, carrots, and onions.

- Basting:
  - Use a baster to generously coat the human meat with the reserved marinade and human blood. This will keep the meat moist and infuse it with a rich, savory flavor.

- Roasting:
  - Roast in the preheated oven for approximately 25 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare.

- Resting:
  - Allow the roast to rest for 15 minutes before carving to ensure the juices redistribute and the meat remains tender.

- Serve:
  - Carve the human roast into slices and arrange them on a platter.
  - Garnish with fresh herbs and serve with a side of roasted vegetables.
