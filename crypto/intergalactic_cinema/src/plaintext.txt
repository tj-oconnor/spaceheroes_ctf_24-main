### line 1 ###
well, my dad was a farmer.

### line 2 ###
um, like everybody else back then.

### line 3 ###
of course, he didn't start that way.

### line 4 ###
computer says you're too tight.

### line 5 ###
- nah, i got this.

### line 6 ###
- crossing the straights.

### line 7 ###
- shutting it down, cooper.

### line 8 ###
- no!

### line 9 ###
- shutting it all down.

### line 10 ###
- no, i need power up!

### line 11 ###
dad?

### line 12 ###
sorry, murph. go back to bed.

### line 13 ###
- i thought you were the ghost.

### line 14 ###
- no.

### line 15 ###
there are no such things as ghosts, babe.

### line 16 ###
grandpa says you can get ghosts.

### line 17 ###
maybe that's because grandpa's close

### line 18 ###
to being one himself. back to bed.

### line 19 ###
were you dreaming about the crash?

### line 20 ###
get your butt back in bed, murph. heh.

### line 21 ###
the wheat had died.

### line 22 ###
the blight came and we had to burn it.

### line 23 ###
and we still had corn.

### line 24 ###
we had acres of corn.

### line 25 ###
but, uh, mostly we had dust.

### line 26 ###
i guess i can't describe it.

### line 27 ###
it was just constant.

### line 28 ###
just that steady blow...

### line 29 ###
of dirt.

### line 30 ###
we wore, um, little strips of sheet...

### line 31 ###
sometimes over our nose and mouth...

### line 32 ###
so that we wouldn't

### line 33 ###
breathe so much of it.

### line 34 ###
when we set the table,

### line 35 ###
we always set the plate...

### line 36 ###
upside-down.

### line 37 ###
glasses or cups, whatever it was...

### line 38 ###
upside-down.

### line 39 ###
shake a leg! murph, get a move on!

### line 40 ###
tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,

### line 41 ###
herbicide resistance 101.

### line 42 ###
- check?

### line 43 ###
- yes, sir.

### line 44 ###
not at the table, murph.

### line 45 ###
dad, can you fix this?

### line 46 ###
what the heck did you do...

### line 47 ###
- to my lander?

### line 48 ###
- wasn't me.

### line 49 ###
let me guess. it was your ghost?

### line 50 ###
it knocked it off.

### line 51 ###
it keeps knocking books off.

### line 52 ###
no such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

### line 53 ###
hey.

### line 54 ###
i looked it up. it's

### line 55 ###
called a poltergeist.

### line 56 ###
dad, tell her.

### line 57 ###
well, it's not very scientific, murph.

### line 58 ###
you said science was about admitting

### line 59 ###
what we don't know.

### line 60 ###
- she's got you there.

### line 61 ###
- hey.

### line 62 ###
start looking after our stuff.

### line 63 ###
coop.

### line 64 ###
all right, murph, you want to talk science?

### line 65 ###
don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.

### line 66 ###
no, you got to go further.

### line 67 ###
you got to record the facts, analyse,

### line 68 ###
get to the how and the why...

### line 69 ###
then present your conclusions. deal?

### line 70 ###
- deal.

### line 71 ###
- all right.

### line 72 ###
- have a good day at school.

### line 73 ###
- hold up.

### line 74 ###
parent-teacher conferences. parent.

### line 75 ###
not grandparent.

### line 76 ###
slow down, turbo!

### line 77 ###
- that's not a dust storm.

### line 78 ###
- nelson's torching his whole crop.

### line 79 ###
blight?

### line 80 ###
they're saying it's

### line 81 ###
the last harvest for okra.

### line 82 ###
ever.

### line 83 ###
he should've planted corn

### line 84 ###
like the rest of us.

### line 85 ###
now, be nice to that miss hanley.

### line 86 ###
she's single.

### line 87 ###
what's that supposed to mean?

### line 88 ###
repopulating the earth.

### line 89 ###
start pulling your weight, young man.

### line 90 ###
why don't you start

### line 91 ###
minding your own business, old man?

### line 92 ###
all right, murph, give me second.

### line 93 ###
uh-huh.

### line 94 ###
third.

### line 95 ###
- find a gear, dumb-ass.

### line 96 ###
- grind it!

### line 97 ###
shut it, tom!

### line 98 ###
- what'd you do, murph?

### line 99 ###
- ah, she didn't do nothing.

### line 100 ###
- blew a tire is all.

### line 101 ###
- murphy's law.

### line 102 ###
shut up!

### line 103 ###
- grab the spare, tom.

### line 104 ###
- that is the spare.

### line 105 ###
get the patch kit!

### line 106 ###
how am i supposed to patch it out here?

### line 107 ###
you got to figure it out.

### line 108 ###
i'm not always gonna be here to help you.

### line 109 ###
what's going on, murph?

### line 110 ###
why did you and mom name me

### line 111 ###
after something that's bad?

### line 112 ###
we didn't.

### line 113 ###
murphy's law?

### line 114 ###
murphy's law doesn't mean

### line 115 ###
that something bad will happen.

### line 116 ###
what it means is

### line 117 ###
whatever can happen will happen.

### line 118 ###
and that sounded just fine with us.

### line 119 ###
whoa!

### line 120 ###
get in.

### line 121 ###
get in, let's go.

### line 122 ###
what about the flat tire?

### line 123 ###
yeah.

### line 124 ###
it's an indian air force drone.

### line 125 ###
solar cells could power an entire farm.

### line 126 ###
take the wheel, tom.

### line 127 ###
go, go, go!

### line 128 ###
keep that aimed right at it.

### line 129 ###
faster, tom. i'm losing it.

### line 130 ###
right at it.

### line 131 ###
stay on it.

### line 132 ###
here we go.

### line 133 ###
whoa.

### line 134 ###
nice one, tom.

### line 135 ###
dad?

### line 136 ###
i almost got it. don't stop. don't stop!

### line 137 ###
dad!

### line 138 ###
tom!

### line 139 ###
you told me to keep driving.

### line 140 ###
well, i guess that answers the old "if i

### line 141 ###
asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

### line 142 ###
- we lost it.

### line 143 ###
- no, we didn't.

### line 144 ###
want to give it a whirl?

### line 145 ###
this way.

### line 146 ###
go.

### line 147 ###
let's lay her down right there

### line 148 ###
at the edge of the reservoir.

### line 149 ###
nicely done.

### line 150 ###
how long you think it's been up there?

### line 151 ###
delhi mission control went down,

### line 152 ###
same as ours...

### line 153 ###
- ten years ago.

### line 154 ###
- heh.

### line 155 ###
so for ten years?

### line 156 ###
- why did it come down so low?

### line 157 ###
- i don't know.

### line 158 ###
maybe the sun cooked its brain

### line 159 ###
or it was looking for something.

### line 160 ###
- what?

### line 161 ###
- give me a large flat-blade.

### line 162 ###
maybe some kind of signal? i don't know.

### line 163 ###
what are you gonna do with it?

### line 164 ###
i'm gonna give it something

### line 165 ###
socially responsible to do...

### line 166 ###
like drive a combine.

### line 167 ###
can't we just let it go?

### line 168 ###
it wasn't hurting anybody.

### line 169 ###
this thing needs to learn

### line 170 ###
how to adapt, murph...

### line 171 ###
like the rest of us.

### line 172 ###
how's this work?

### line 173 ###
you guys come with?

### line 174 ###
i've got class.

### line 175 ###
this one needs to wait.

### line 176 ###
- what did you do?

### line 177 ###
- they'll tell you about it in there.

### line 178 ###
- am i gonna be mad?

### line 179 ###
- not with me.

### line 180 ###
- just please try not to.

### line 181 ###
- hey. relax.

### line 182 ###
i got this.

### line 183 ###
little late, coop.

### line 184 ###
yeah, we had a flat.

### line 185 ###
and i guess you had to stop off

### line 186 ###
at the asian fighter plane store.

### line 187 ###
no, actually, sir, that's

### line 188 ###
a surveillance drone.

### line 189 ###
with outstanding solar cells. it's indian.

### line 190 ###
take a seat.

### line 191 ###
so, uh...

### line 192 ###
we got tom's scores back.

### line 193 ###
he's going to make an excellent farmer.

### line 194 ###
yeah, he's got a knack for it.

### line 195 ###
what about college?

### line 196 ###
the university only takes a handful.

### line 197 ###
they don't have the resources to...

### line 198 ###
i still pay my taxes.

### line 199 ###
where's that money go?

### line 200 ###
there's no more armies.

### line 201 ###
well, it doesn't go to the university.

### line 202 ###
look, coop, you have to be realistic.

### line 203 ###
you're ruling my son out for college now?

### line 204 ###
- the kid's 15.

### line 205 ###
- tom's score simply isn't high enough.

### line 206 ###
what's your waistline? about what, 32?

### line 207 ###
about a 33 inseam?

### line 208 ###
i'm not sure i see

### line 209 ###
what you're getting at.

### line 210 ###
it takes two numbers to measure your ass

### line 211 ###
but only one to measure my son's future?

### line 212 ###
come on. you're a well-educated man, coop.

### line 213 ###
- and a trained pilot.

### line 214 ###
- and an engineer.

### line 215 ###
okay, well, right now

### line 216 ###
we don't need more engineers.

### line 217 ###
we didn't run out of television screens

### line 218 ###
and planes. we ran out of food.

### line 219 ###
the world needs farmers.

### line 220 ###
good farmers, like you.

### line 221 ###
- and tom.

### line 222 ###
- uneducated farmers.

### line 223 ###
we're a caretaker generation, coop.

### line 224 ###
and things are getting better.

### line 225 ###
maybe your grandkids

### line 226 ###
will get to be engin...

### line 227 ###
are we done here, sir?

### line 228 ###
no.

### line 229 ###
miss hanley's here to talk about murph.

### line 230 ###
murph is a great kid. she's really bright.

### line 231 ###
but she's been having a

### line 232 ###
little trouble lately.

### line 233 ###
she brought this in to show the students.

### line 234 ###
the section on the lunar landings.

### line 235 ###
yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

### line 236 ###
she always loved the pictures.

### line 237 ###
it's an old federal textbook. we've

### line 238 ###
replaced them with the corrected versions.

### line 239 ###
corrected?

### line 240 ###
explaining how the apollo missions were

### line 241 ###
faked to bankrupt the soviet union.

### line 242 ###
you don't believe we went to the moon?

### line 243 ###
it was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

### line 244 ###
the soviets bankrupted themselves

### line 245 ###
pouring resources...

### line 246 ###
into rockets and other useless machines.

### line 247 ###
"useless machines."

### line 248 ###
if we don't want a repeat of the excess and

### line 249 ###
wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

### line 250 ###
we need to teach our kids about

### line 251 ###
this planet, not tales of leaving it.

### line 252 ###
one of those useless machines

### line 253 ###
they used to make was called an mri.

### line 254 ###
if we had any of those left,

### line 255 ###
the doctors would've been able to find...

### line 256 ###
the cyst in my wife's brain

### line 257 ###
before she died instead of afterwards.

### line 258 ###
then she'd have been the one

### line 259 ###
listening to this instead of me...

### line 260 ###
which would have been a good thing,

### line 261 ###
because she was always...

### line 262 ###
the calmer one.

### line 263 ###
i'm sorry about your wife, mr. cooper.

### line 264 ###
but murph got into a fistfight

### line 265 ###
with several of her classmates over this...

### line 266 ###
apollo nonsense.

### line 267 ###
so we thought it best

### line 268 ###
to bring you in and see what ideas...

### line 269 ###
you might have for dealing

### line 270 ###
with her behaviour on the home front.

### line 271 ###
yeah, you know what?

### line 272 ###
um, there's a game tomorrow night.

### line 273 ###
she's going through a bit

### line 274 ###
of a baseball phase.

### line 275 ###
her favourite team is playing.

### line 276 ###
there's gonna be candy and soda and...

### line 277 ###
i think i'll take her to that.

### line 278 ###
how'd it go?

### line 279 ###
i got you suspended.

### line 280 ###
- what?

### line 281 ###
- cooper.

### line 282 ###
this is cooper. go.

### line 283 ###
coop, those combines you rebuilt

### line 284 ###
went haywire.

### line 285 ###
just reset the controllers.

### line 286 ###
i did that. now you

### line 287 ###
should come take a look.

### line 288 ###
one by one they've been

### line 289 ###
peeling off the fields and heading over.

### line 290 ###
something's interfering with the compass.

### line 291 ###
magnetism or some such.

### line 292 ###
nothing special about which book.

### line 293 ###
i've been working on it, like you said.

### line 294 ###
- i counted the spaces.

### line 295 ###
- why?

### line 296 ###
in case the ghost is trying to communicate.

### line 297 ###
i'm trying morse.

### line 298 ###
morse?

### line 299 ###
yeah.

### line 300 ###
- dots and dashes, used...

### line 301 ###
- i know what morse code is, murph.

### line 302 ###
i just don't think

### line 303 ###
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

### line 304 ###
had to reset every compass clock and gps

### line 305 ###
to offset for the anomaly.

### line 306 ###
- which is?

### line 307 ###
- i don't know.

### line 308 ###
if the house was built on magnetic ore...

### line 309 ###
we'd have seen this the first time

### line 310 ###
we switched on the tractor.

### line 311 ###
i hear your meeting at the school

### line 312 ###
didn't go so well.

### line 313 ###
heh. you heard?

### line 314 ###
it's like we've forgotten

### line 315 ###
who we are, donald.

### line 316 ###
explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

### line 317 ###
when i was a kid...

### line 318 ###
it felt like they made something new

### line 319 ###
every day. some...

### line 320 ###
gadget or idea.

### line 321 ###
like every day was christmas.

### line 322 ###
but six billion people...

### line 323 ###
just try to imagine that.

### line 324 ###
and every last one of them

### line 325 ###
trying to have it all.

### line 326 ###
this world isn't so bad.

### line 327 ###
and tom will do just fine.

### line 328 ###
you're the one who doesn't belong. born

### line 329 ###
my daughter knew it, god bless her.

### line 330 ###
and your kids know it. especially murph.

### line 331 ###
well, we used to look up in the sky

### line 332 ###
and wonder...

### line 333 ###
at our place in the stars.

### line 334 ###
now we just look down and worry

### line 335 ###
about our place in the dirt.

### line 336 ###
cooper, you were good at something...

### line 337 ###
and you never got a chance

### line 338 ###
to do anything with it.

### line 339 ###
i'm sorry.

### line 340 ###
you didn't expect...

### line 341 ###
this dirt that was

### line 342 ###
giving you this food...

### line 343 ###
to turn on you like

### line 344 ###
that and destroy you.

### line 345 ###
in april... i believe i'm right...

### line 346 ###
fifteenth of april, i think.

### line 347 ###
this happened about 1:30 when that thing...

### line 348 ###
came off the top of that canyon.

### line 349 ###
in my day, we had real ballplayers.

### line 350 ###
who are these bums?

### line 351 ###
in my day, people were too busy...

### line 352 ###
fighting over food

### line 353 ###
to even play baseball.

### line 354 ###
popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.

### line 355 ###
i want a hot dog.

### line 356 ###
school says you're gonna follow

### line 357 ###
in my footsteps.

### line 358 ###
i think that's great.

### line 359 ###
- you think that's great?

### line 360 ###
- you hate farming, dad.

### line 361 ###
grandpa said.

### line 362 ###
grandpa said, huh?

### line 363 ###
listen, all that matters

### line 364 ###
is how you feel about it.

### line 365 ###
i like what you do.

### line 366 ###
i like our farm.

### line 367 ###
you're gonna be great at it.

### line 368 ###
let's get out of here.

### line 369 ###
all right, it's a doozy.

### line 370 ###
all right, gang, let's mask up.

### line 371 ###
- tom? murph? check?

### line 372 ###
- yeah.

### line 373 ###
murph, tom, you guys shut your windows?

### line 374 ###
murph?

### line 375 ###
the ghost.

### line 376 ###
grab your pillow.

### line 377 ###
you're sleeping in with tom.

### line 378 ###
it's not a ghost.

### line 379 ###
it's gravity.

### line 380 ###
i'm dropping tom, then heading to town.

### line 381 ###
you want to clean that up

### line 382 ###
when you've finished praying to it?

### line 383 ###
it's not morse, murph. it's binary.

### line 384 ###
thick is one, thin is zero.

### line 385 ###
coordinates.

### line 386 ###
nope. mm-mm.

### line 387 ###
here we go.

### line 388 ###
thirty-three.

### line 389 ###
that's it.

### line 390 ###
i can't miss this!

### line 391 ###
grandpa will be back in

### line 392 ###
a couple hours, murph.

### line 393 ###
but you don't know what you're gonna find.

### line 394 ###
and that...

### line 395 ###
is why i can't take you.

### line 396 ###
murph?

### line 397 ###
grandpa will be home in a while.

### line 398 ###
tell him i'll call him on the radio.

### line 399 ###
- aah!

### line 400 ###
- jesus.

### line 401 ###
- what are you doing?

### line 402 ###
- heh-heh.

### line 403 ###
oh, you think this is funny? huh?

### line 404 ###
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

### line 405 ###
make yourself useful.

### line 406 ###
hey, murph?

### line 407 ###
murph!

### line 408 ###
i think this is the end of the road.

### line 409 ###
didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

### line 410 ###
that's my girl.

### line 411 ###
step away!

### line 412 ###
don't shoot! i'm not armed.

### line 413 ###
my daughter's in the car.

### line 414 ###
- don't be afraid.

### line 415 ###
- aah!

### line 416 ###
how did you find this place?

### line 417 ###
where's my daughter?

### line 418 ###
you had the coordinates for this facility

### line 419 ###
marked on your map. where did you get them?

### line 420 ###
where's my daughter?

### line 421 ###
don't make me take you down again.

### line 422 ###
sit down!

### line 423 ###
oh, you still think you're a marine, pal?

### line 424 ###
marines don't exist anymore.

### line 425 ###
and i got grunts like

### line 426 ###
you mowing my grass.

### line 427 ###
where did you find

### line 428 ###
those coordinates?

### line 429 ###
but you don't look much like a lawnmower.

### line 430 ###
think i'll turn you

### line 431 ###
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

### line 432 ###
no, you won't.

### line 433 ###
tars, back down, please.

### line 434 ###
you know, you're taking a risk

### line 435 ###
using ex-military security.

### line 436 ###
they're old, and their control units

### line 437 ###
are unpredictable.

### line 438 ###
it's what the government could spare.

### line 439 ###
who are you?

### line 440 ###
dr. brand.

### line 441 ###
i knew a dr. brand once.

### line 442 ###
he was a professor.

### line 443 ###
what makes you think i'm not?

### line 444 ###
wasn't near as cute, either.

### line 445 ###
please, dr. brand.

### line 446 ###
i don't have any idea what this is.

### line 447 ###
now i'm scared for my daughter

### line 448 ###
and want her by my side.

### line 449 ###
you give me that,

### line 450 ###
i'll tell you anything you want to know.

### line 451 ###
get the principals and the girl

### line 452 ###
in the conference room, please.

### line 453 ###
your daughter is fine.

### line 454 ###
bright kid.

### line 455 ###
must have a very smart mother.

### line 456 ###
it's pretty clear you

### line 457 ###
don't want any visitors.

### line 458 ###
so why don't you just let us back up from

### line 459 ###
your fence and we'll be on our way? huh?

### line 460 ###
- it's not that simple.

### line 461 ###
- well, sure, it is.

### line 462 ###
i don't know anything about you.

### line 463 ###
i don't know anything about this place.

### line 464 ###
yes, you do.

### line 465 ###
dad!

### line 466 ###
hello, cooper.

### line 467 ###
professor brand.

### line 468 ###
explain to me how you found this facility.

### line 469 ###
kind of an accident. we sort of stumbled

### line 470 ###
upon it. we were on a salvage run...

### line 471 ###
you're sitting in the best-kept secret

### line 472 ###
in the world.

### line 473 ###
nobody stumbles in here.

### line 474 ###
nobody stumbles out.

### line 475 ###
cooper, please.

### line 476 ###
cooperate with these people.

### line 477 ###
look.

### line 478 ###
it's kind of hard to explain.

### line 479 ###
we learned these coordinates

### line 480 ###
from an anomaly.

### line 481 ###
what sort of anomaly?

### line 482 ###
i hesitate to term it supernatural,

### line 483 ###
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

### line 484 ###
you're going to have to be specific,

### line 485 ###
mr. cooper. right now.

### line 486 ###
it was gravity.

### line 487 ###
um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?

### line 488 ###
where was this?

### line 489 ###
now, i'm real happy that you're excited

### line 490 ###
about gravity, bud...

### line 491 ###
but you're not getting any answers

### line 492 ###
from us until i get assurances.

### line 493 ###
- assurances?

### line 494 ###
- yeah.

### line 495 ###
like, that we're getting out of here.

### line 496 ###
and i don't mean in the trunk of some car.

### line 497 ###
don't you know who we are, coop?

### line 498 ###
no, professor, i don't.

### line 499 ###
you know my father, professor brand.

### line 500 ###
we're nasa.

### line 501 ###
- nasa?

### line 502 ###
- nasa.

### line 503 ###
the same nasa you flew for.

### line 504 ###
i heard they shut you down, sir...

### line 505 ###
for refusing to drop bombs

### line 506 ###
from the stratosphere...

### line 507 ###
onto starving people.

### line 508 ###
when they realised

### line 509 ###
that killing other people was...

### line 510 ###
not a long-term solution,

### line 511 ###
then they needed us back.

### line 512 ###
- in secret.

### line 513 ###
- why secret?

### line 514 ###
because public opinion wouldn't

### line 515 ###
allow spending on space exploration.

### line 516 ###
not while you're struggling

### line 517 ###
to put food on the table.

### line 518 ###
blight.

### line 519 ###
wheat seven years ago. okra this year.

### line 520 ###
now there's just corn.

### line 521 ###
and we're growing more than we ever have.

### line 522 ###
but like the potatoes in ireland

### line 523 ###
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

### line 524 ###
the corn will die.

### line 525 ###
soon.

### line 526 ###
we'll find a way, professor.

### line 527 ###
we always have.

### line 528 ###
driven by the unshakable faith

### line 529 ###
the earth is ours.

### line 530 ###
not just ours, no.

### line 531 ###
but it is our home.

### line 532 ###
earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

### line 533 ###
we don't even breathe nitrogen.

### line 534 ###
blight does. and as it thrives,

### line 535 ###
our air gets less and less oxygen.

### line 536 ###
the last people to starve

### line 537 ###
will be the first to suffocate.

### line 538 ###
and your daughter's generation...

### line 539 ###
will be the last to survive on earth.

### line 540 ###
murph is tired. i was wondering

### line 541 ###
if she could take a nap in my office.

### line 542 ###
yeah. thank you.

### line 543 ###
okay...

### line 544 ###
now you need to tell me

### line 545 ###
what your plan is to save the world.

### line 546 ###
we're not meant to save the world.

### line 547 ###
we're meant to leave it.

### line 548 ###
rangers.

### line 549 ###
the last components of our one versatile

### line 550 ###
ship in orbit, the endurance.

### line 551 ###
our final expedition.

### line 552 ###
you sent people out there

### line 553 ###
looking for a new home?

### line 554 ###
the lazarus missions.

### line 555 ###
- oh, that sounds cheerful.

### line 556 ###
- lazarus came back from the dead.

### line 557 ###
sure, but he had to die in the first place.

### line 558 ###
there's not a planet in our solar system

### line 559 ###
that could sustain life...

### line 560 ###
and the nearest star's

### line 561 ###
over a thousand years away.

### line 562 ###
that doesn't even qualify as futile.

### line 563 ###
where'd you send them?

### line 564 ###
cooper...

### line 565 ###
i can't tell you anymore

### line 566 ###
unless you agree...

### line 567 ###
to pilot this craft.

### line 568 ###
- you're the best pilot we ever had.

### line 569 ###
- i barely left the stratosphere.

### line 570 ###
this team never left the simulator.

### line 571 ###
we need a pilot, and this is the mission

### line 572 ###
that you were trained for.

### line 573 ###
without even knowing it?

### line 574 ###
an hour ago, you didn't even know i

### line 575 ###
was alive. you were going anyway.

### line 576 ###
we had no choice.

### line 577 ###
but something sent you here.

### line 578 ###
- they chose you.

### line 579 ###
- who's "they"?

### line 580 ###
how long would i be gone?

### line 581 ###
hard to know. years?

### line 582 ###
i've got kids, professor.

### line 583 ###
get out there and save them.

### line 584 ###
who's "they"?

### line 585 ###
we started detecting gravitational

### line 586 ###
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

### line 587 ###
mostly small distortions to our instruments

### line 588 ###
in the upper atmosphere.

### line 589 ###
in fact, i believe

### line 590 ###
you encountered one yourself.

### line 591 ###
yeah, over the straights.

### line 592 ###
my crash. something tripped my fly-by-wire.

### line 593 ###
exactly.

### line 594 ###
but of all these anomalies,

### line 595 ###
the most significant is this:

### line 596 ###
out near saturn...

### line 597 ###
a disturbance of space-time.

### line 598 ###
- is that a wormhole?

### line 599 ###
- it appeared 48 years ago.

### line 600 ###
and it leads where?

### line 601 ###
another galaxy.

### line 602 ###
a wormhole's not

### line 603 ###
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

### line 604 ###
someone placed it there.

### line 605 ###
- "they"?

### line 606 ###
- mm.

### line 607 ###
and whoever they are,

### line 608 ###
they appear to be looking out for us.

### line 609 ###
that wormhole lets us

### line 610 ###
travel to other stars.

### line 611 ###
it came along right as we needed it.

### line 612 ###
they've put potentially habitable worlds

### line 613 ###
right within our reach.

### line 614 ###
twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

### line 615 ###
- you sent probes into that?

### line 616 ###
- mm-hm.

### line 617 ###
we sent people into it. ten years ago.

### line 618 ###
the lazarus missions.

### line 619 ###
twelve possible worlds...

### line 620 ###
twelve ranger launches carrying...

### line 621 ###
the bravest humans ever to live...

### line 622 ###
led by the remarkable dr. mann.

### line 623 ###
each person's landing pod

### line 624 ###
had enough life support for two years.

### line 625 ###
but they could use hibernation

### line 626 ###
to stretch that...

### line 627 ###
making observations on organics

### line 628 ###
over a decade or more.

### line 629 ###
their mission was to assess their world,

### line 630 ###
and if it showed potential...

### line 631 ###
then they could send out a signal, bed

### line 632 ###
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

### line 633 ###
and what if the world didn't show promise?

### line 634 ###
hence the bravery.

### line 635 ###
you don't have the resources

### line 636 ###
to visit all 12.

### line 637 ###
no.

### line 638 ###
data transmission back through

### line 639 ###
the wormhole is rudimentary.

### line 640 ###
simple binary pings on

### line 641 ###
an annual basis give us

### line 642 ###
some clue as to which

### line 643 ###
worlds have potential.

### line 644 ###
and one system shows promise.

### line 645 ###
one. that's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

### line 646 ###
one system with three potential worlds?

### line 647 ###
no long shot.

### line 648 ###
okay.

### line 649 ###
so if we find a home...

### line 650 ###
- then what?

### line 651 ###
- that's the long shot.

### line 652 ###
there's a plan a and a plan b.

### line 653 ###
did you notice anything strange

### line 654 ###
about the launch chamber?

### line 655 ###
this entire facility's a centrifuge.

### line 656 ###
some kind of vehicle. a space station?

### line 657 ###
both. plan a.

### line 658 ###
how do you get it off the ground?

### line 659 ###
the first gravitational anomalies

### line 660 ###
changed everything.

### line 661 ###
suddenly we knew

### line 662 ###
that harnessing gravity was real.

### line 663 ###
so i started working on a theory

### line 664 ###
and we started building this station.

### line 665 ###
but you haven't solved it yet.

### line 666 ###
that's why there's plan b.

### line 667 ###
the problem is gravity. how to get a viable

### line 668 ###
amount of human life off the planet.

### line 669 ###
this is one way.

### line 670 ###
plan b: a population bomb.

### line 671 ###
over 5,000 fertilised eggs

### line 672 ###
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

### line 673 ###
how would you raise them?

### line 674 ###
with equipment on board,

### line 675 ###
we incubate the first 10.

### line 676 ###
after that, with surrogacy,

### line 677 ###
the growth becomes exponential.

### line 678 ###
within 30 years,

### line 679 ###
we could have a colony of hundreds.

### line 680 ###
the real difficulty with colonisation

### line 681 ###
is genetic diversity.

### line 682 ###
this takes care of that.

### line 683 ###
but what about the people here? you just...

### line 684 ###
give up on them?

### line 685 ###
my kids?

### line 686 ###
that's why plan a is a lot more fun.

### line 687 ###
- how far have you got?

### line 688 ###
- almost there.

### line 689 ###
you're asking me to hang everything...

### line 690 ###
on an almost.

### line 691 ###
i'm asking you to trust me.

### line 692 ###
find us a new home.

### line 693 ###
and by the time you return...

### line 694 ###
i will have solved

### line 695 ###
the problem of gravity.

### line 696 ###
i give you my word.

### line 697 ###
go away!

### line 698 ###
murph.

### line 699 ###
go! if you're leaving, just go.

### line 700 ###
this world was never enough

### line 701 ###
for you, was it, coop?

### line 702 ###
what, because heading out there

### line 703 ###
is what i feel like i was born to do?

### line 704 ###
and it excites me? heh.

### line 705 ###
no, that does not make it wrong.

### line 706 ###
it might.

### line 707 ###
don't trust the right thing

### line 708 ###
done for the wrong reason.

### line 709 ###
the why of the thing,

### line 710 ###
that's the foundation.

### line 711 ###
and the foundation's solid.

### line 712 ###
we farmers, we sit here every year

### line 713 ###
when the rains fail and we say:

### line 714 ###
"next year."

### line 715 ###
well, next year ain't gonna save us,

### line 716 ###
nor the one after that.

### line 717 ###
this world's a treasure, donald, but it's

### line 718 ###
been telling us to leave for a while now.

### line 719 ###
mankind was born on earth,

### line 720 ###
it was never meant to die here.

### line 721 ###
tom will be all right, but you got

### line 722 ###
to make things right with murph.

### line 723 ###
i will.

### line 724 ###
without making promises

### line 725 ###
you don't know you can keep.

### line 726 ###
you have to talk to me, murph.

### line 727 ###
i need to fix this before i go.

### line 728 ###
then i'll keep it

### line 729 ###
broken so you have to stay.

### line 730 ###
after you kids came along, your mom said

### line 731 ###
something to me i never quite understood.

### line 732 ###
she said, "now...

### line 733 ###
we're just here

### line 734 ###
to be memories for our kids."

### line 735 ###
and i think that now i understand

### line 736 ###
what she meant.

### line 737 ###
once you're a parent,

### line 738 ###
you're the ghost of your children's future.

### line 739 ###
you said ghosts didn't exist.

### line 740 ###
that's right, murph.

### line 741 ###
murph, look at me.

### line 742 ###
i can't be your ghost right now.

### line 743 ###
i need to exist.

### line 744 ###
they chose me.

### line 745 ###
murph, they chose me. you saw.

### line 746 ###
you're the one who led me to them.

### line 747 ###
that's exactly why you can't go.

### line 748 ###
i figured out the message.

### line 749 ###
- one word. know what it is?

### line 750 ###
- murph.

### line 751 ###
"stay."

### line 752 ###
- it says, "stay," dad.

### line 753 ###
- murph.

### line 754 ###
you don't believe me.

### line 755 ###
look at the books! look at this.

### line 756 ###
it says, "stay."

### line 757 ###
why...? you're not listening!

### line 758 ###
it says, "stay!"

### line 759 ###
no, i'm coming back.

### line 760 ###
when?

### line 761 ###
one for you, one for me.

### line 762 ###
when i'm up there in hypersleep, or...

### line 763 ###
travelling near the speed of light, or...

### line 764 ###
near a black hole...

### line 765 ###
time's gonna change for me.

### line 766 ###
it's gonna run more slowly.

### line 767 ###
when we get back...

### line 768 ###
we're gonna compare.

### line 769 ###
- time will run differently for us?

### line 770 ###
- yeah.

### line 771 ###
by the time i get back,

### line 772 ###
we might even be the same age, you and me.

### line 773 ###
"what?" imagine that!

### line 774 ###
aw, murph...

### line 775 ###
you have no idea when you're coming back.

### line 776 ###
no idea at all!

### line 777 ###
murph, don't... don't

### line 778 ###
make me leave like this.

### line 779 ###
come on, murph!

### line 780 ###
don't make me leave like this, murph!

### line 781 ###
hey...

### line 782 ###
i love you.

### line 783 ###
forever. you hear me?

### line 784 ###
i love you forever, and i'm coming back.

### line 785 ###
i'm coming back.

### line 786 ###
- how'd it go?

### line 787 ###
- fine.

### line 788 ###
just fine.

### line 789 ###
i love you, tom.

### line 790 ###
- travel safe, huh?

### line 791 ###
- yeah.

### line 792 ###
you look after our place for me, all right?

### line 793 ###
- all right?

### line 794 ###
- uh-huh.

### line 795 ###
hey, can i use your

### line 796 ###
truck while you're gone?

### line 797 ###
you mean your truck?

### line 798 ###
i'll make sure they bring it back.

### line 799 ###
look after my kids, donald!

### line 800 ###
go for main engine start. t-minus 10...

### line 801 ###
- dad!

### line 802 ###
- nine... dad!

### line 803 ###
eight...

### line 804 ###
seven... dad!

### line 805 ###
six...

### line 806 ###
five, main engine start, four...

### line 807 ###
three...

### line 808 ###
two...

### line 809 ###
one. booster ignition and...

### line 810 ###
all engines look good.

### line 811 ###
beginning roll program.

### line 812 ###
prepare for stage one separation.

### line 813 ###
stage one.

### line 814 ###
there is mach 1.

### line 815 ###
everybody good?

### line 816 ###
plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

### line 817 ###
they gave him a humour setting

### line 818 ###
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

### line 819 ###
he thinks it relaxes us.

### line 820 ###
a giant sarcastic robot.

### line 821 ###
what a great idea!

### line 822 ###
i have a cue light i can use

### line 823 ###
when i'm joking if you like.

### line 824 ###
that'd probably help.

### line 825 ###
you can use it to find your way back to the

### line 826 ###
ship after i blow you out the airlock.

### line 827 ###
- what's your humour setting, tars?

### line 828 ###
- that's 100 percent.

### line 829 ###
let's bring it on down to 75, please.

### line 830 ###
stage two separation.

### line 831 ###
all feeds going manual.

### line 832 ###
going manual.

### line 833 ###
deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

### line 834 ###
check.

### line 835 ###
- taking control.

### line 836 ###
- this is handover to you.

### line 837 ###
- a.d.f. check.

### line 838 ###
- over.

### line 839 ###
pull thrusters back.

### line 840 ###
fuel cells one, two, three.

### line 841 ###
one hundred percent.

### line 842 ###
ex-mites.

### line 843 ###
it's hard leaving everything.

### line 844 ###
my kids. your father.

### line 845 ###
we're going to be spending

### line 846 ###
a lot of time together.

### line 847 ###
- we should learn to talk.

### line 848 ###
- and when not to.

### line 849 ###
just being honest.

### line 850 ###
i don't think you need to be that honest.

### line 851 ###
hey, tars, what's your honesty parameter?

### line 852 ###
- ninety percent.

### line 853 ###
- ninety percent?

### line 854 ###
absolute honesty isn't always

### line 855 ###
the most diplomatic, nor the...

### line 856 ###
safest form of communication

### line 857 ###
with emotional beings.

### line 858 ###
okay.

### line 859 ###
ninety percent it is, dr. brand.

### line 860 ###
we are coming up on the endurance.

### line 861 ###
twelve minutes out.

### line 862 ###
okay. taking control.

### line 863 ###
approaching module port, 500 metres.

### line 864 ###
it's all you, doyle.

### line 865 ###
nice and easy, doyle. nice and easy.

### line 866 ###
i feel good.

### line 867 ###
take us home.

### line 868 ###
- lock.

### line 869 ###
- target locked.

### line 870 ###
- well done.

### line 871 ###
- okay, helmets on.

### line 872 ###
good job.

### line 873 ###
door's not charging.

### line 874 ###
never mind.

### line 875 ###
cooper, you should have control.

### line 876 ###
control here.

### line 877 ###
communication with ring module active.

### line 878 ###
oh, wow.

### line 879 ###
that's initiate.

### line 880 ###
- are we ready to spin?

### line 881 ###
- just a sec.

### line 882 ###
- hello, case.

### line 883 ###
- hello, tars.

### line 884 ###
all right, we're all set.

### line 885 ###
all right, let's do it.

### line 886 ###
heh.

### line 887 ###
thirty percent of spin.

### line 888 ###
one g.

### line 889 ###
how's gravity treating you back there?

### line 890 ###
well.

### line 891 ###
romilly? hey, you okay?

### line 892 ###
- yeah.

### line 893 ###
- you all right?

### line 894 ###
mm. yeah, i just need a minute.

### line 895 ###
we have some dramamine in the hab pod, or

### line 896 ###
maybe in the cryo-beds. i'll just be a sec.

### line 897 ###
- hey, brand?

### line 898 ###
- yeah?

### line 899 ###
- bring a lot.

### line 900 ###
- heh-heh-heh.

### line 901 ###
amelia, be safe.

### line 902 ###
- give my regards to dr. mann.

### line 903 ###
- i will, dad.

### line 904 ###
it looks good for your trajectory.

### line 905 ###
we've calculated two years to saturn.

### line 906 ###
that's a lot of dramamine.

### line 907 ###
look after my family,

### line 908 ###
will you, please, sir?

### line 909 ###
we'll be waiting for you when you get back.

### line 910 ###
a little older, a little wiser,

### line 911 ###
but happy to see you.

### line 912 ###
do not go gentle into that good night

### line 913 ###
old age should burn and

### line 914 ###
rave at close of day

### line 915 ###
rage, rage against the dying of the light

### line 916 ###
though wise men at their end

### line 917 ###
know dark is right

### line 918 ###
because their words had forked

### line 919 ###
no lightning they

### line 920 ###
do not go gentle into that good night

### line 921 ###
rage, rage against the dying of the light

### line 922 ###
- you good?

### line 923 ###
- yeah.

### line 924 ###
okay, thank you.

### line 925 ###
here. pills.

### line 926 ###
so alone.

### line 927 ###
we have each other. dr. mann had it worse.

### line 928 ###
no, i mean them.

### line 929 ###
hm?

### line 930 ###
it's a perfect planet,

### line 931 ###
and we won't find another one like her.

### line 932 ###
no, it's not like looking for a new condo.

### line 933 ###
the human race is going to be...

### line 934 ###
adrift...

### line 935 ###
desperate for a rock it can cling to

### line 936 ###
while it catches its breath.

### line 937 ###
we need to find that rock.

### line 938 ###
and our three prospects

### line 939 ###
are at the edge of what...

### line 940 ###
might sustain human life.

### line 941 ###
laura miller's planet is first.

### line 942 ###
- laura started our biology program.

### line 943 ###
mm-hm.

### line 944 ###
- uh, wolf edmunds is here.

### line 945 ###
- tell me about edmunds.

### line 946 ###
oh, uh, wolf's a particle physicist.

### line 947 ###
none of them had families, huh?

### line 948 ###
no. no attachments. my father insisted.

### line 949 ###
they all knew the odds against

### line 950 ###
ever seeing another human being again.

### line 951 ###
i'm hoping we can surprise

### line 952 ###
at least three of them.

### line 953 ###
- how about mann?

### line 954 ###
- dr. mann?

### line 955 ###
he's remarkable. he's the best of us.

### line 956 ###
he inspired 11 people to follow him

### line 957 ###
on the loneliest journey in human history.

### line 958 ###
scientists, explorers.

### line 959 ###
that's what i love.

### line 960 ###
you know, out there we face great odds.

### line 961 ###
death, but...

### line 962 ###
not evil.

### line 963 ###
you don't think nature can be evil?

### line 964 ###
no. formidable. frightening. but...

### line 965 ###
- no, not evil.

### line 966 ###
- hm.

### line 967 ###
is a lion evil

### line 968 ###
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

### line 969 ###
just what we take with us, then.

### line 970 ###
yeah.

### line 971 ###
this crew represents the best of humanity.

### line 972 ###
even me, huh?

### line 973 ###
you know what? we agreed, 90 percent.

### line 974 ###
there you go.

### line 975 ###
- don't stay up.

### line 976 ###
- i'll be there in a minute.

### line 977 ###
just remember, coop,

### line 978 ###
you are literally wasting your breath.

### line 979 ###
hey, tars? let's go over that

### line 980 ###
trajectory one more time.

### line 981 ###
eight months to mars.

### line 982 ###
counter-orbital slingshot around.

### line 983 ###
fourteen months to saturn.

### line 984 ###
nothing's changed on that.

### line 985 ###
just let me ask you something.

### line 986 ###
dr. brand and edmunds...

### line 987 ###
why are you whispering?

### line 988 ###
they can't hear you.

### line 989 ###
dr. brand and edmunds. they close?

### line 990 ###
i wouldn't know.

### line 991 ###
is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"

### line 992 ###
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

### line 993 ###
- i also have a discretion setting, cooper.

### line 994 ###
- aah.

### line 995 ###
but not a poker face, slick.

### line 996 ###
hey, guys.

### line 997 ###
uh, dad's about to go

### line 998 ###
down for the long nap.

### line 999 ###
so i wanted to give you an update.

### line 1000 ###
uh...

### line 1001 ###
the earth looks amazing from here. um...

### line 1002 ###
you can't see any of the dust. heh.

### line 1003 ###
um, i really hope you guys are doing great.

### line 1004 ###
i know you'll get this message. professor

### line 1005 ###
brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

### line 1006 ###
know that i love you.

### line 1007 ###
- is it him?

### line 1008 ###
- i don't think so, murph.

### line 1009 ###
you must be donald.

### line 1010 ###
hello, murph.

### line 1011 ###
why are you in my dad's truck?

### line 1012 ###
he wanted me to bring it for your brother.

### line 1013 ###
he sent you a message.

### line 1014 ###
she's pretty upset with him for leaving.

### line 1015 ###
if you record any messages,

### line 1016 ###
i can get them to transmit it to cooper.

### line 1017 ###
murph is a bright spark.

### line 1018 ###
maybe i should fan the flame.

### line 1019 ###
she's already making fools of her teachers.

### line 1020 ###
so maybe she should come

### line 1021 ###
and make a fool out of you.

### line 1022 ###
- so where are they?

### line 1023 ###
- heading for mars.

### line 1024 ###
the next time you hear from cooper,

### line 1025 ###
they'll be coming up on saturn.

### line 1026 ###
as far as school goes...

### line 1027 ###
the administration wants me

### line 1028 ###
to repeat plant pathology. which sucks.

### line 1029 ###
but they said i could start

### line 1030 ###
advanced agriculture a year early.

### line 1031 ###
all right, i got to go, dad.

### line 1032 ###
hope you're safe up there.

### line 1033 ###
um, sorry, coop.

### line 1034 ###
i asked murph to say hi,

### line 1035 ###
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

### line 1036 ###
i'll try again next time.

### line 1037 ###
you all right, rom?

### line 1038 ###
this gets to me, cooper.

### line 1039 ###
this. this.

### line 1040 ###
millimetres of aluminium, that's it,

### line 1041 ###
and then nothing...

### line 1042 ###
out there for millions of miles

### line 1043 ###
won't kill us in seconds.

### line 1044 ###
you know that some of the finest...

### line 1045 ###
solo yachtsmen in the world

### line 1046 ###
don't know how to swim?

### line 1047 ###
they don't know how. and if they

### line 1048 ###
go overboard, psst, they're done.

### line 1049 ###
we're explorers, rom.

### line 1050 ###
this is our boat.

### line 1051 ###
here.

### line 1052 ###
this is from the, uh, relay probe?

### line 1053 ###
it was in orbit around the wormhole.

### line 1054 ###
this is the wormhole,

### line 1055 ###
and every time we'd come around...

### line 1056 ###
we would receive images

### line 1057 ###
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

### line 1058 ###
oh, yeah. like swinging a periscope around.

### line 1059 ###
exactly.

### line 1060 ###
so we got a pretty good idea what we're

### line 1061 ###
gonna find on the other side, huh?

### line 1062 ###
navigationally.

### line 1063 ###
guys? we'll be approaching

### line 1064 ###
the wormhole in about three hours.

### line 1065 ###
hey, coop?

### line 1066 ###
can we stop the spinning?

### line 1067 ###
why?

### line 1068 ###
because we're close enough to see it now?

### line 1069 ###
all right.

### line 1070 ###
thanks.

### line 1071 ###
there, that's it! that's the wormhole!

### line 1072 ###
say it, don't spray it, rom.

### line 1073 ###
it's a sphere.

### line 1074 ###
of course it is. what, you...?

### line 1075 ###
you thought it would just be a hole?

### line 1076 ###
no, it's just that all the illustrations

### line 1077 ###
i've ever seen, they...

### line 1078 ###
in the illustrations,

### line 1079 ###
they're trying to show you how it works.

### line 1080 ###
so they say you want to go

### line 1081 ###
from here to there.

### line 1082 ###
- but it's too far, right?

### line 1083 ###
- mm-hm.

### line 1084 ###
so a wormhole bends space like this,

### line 1085 ###
so you can take a shortcut through...

### line 1086 ###
a higher dimension.

### line 1087 ###
okay, so...

### line 1088 ###
to show that, they've

### line 1089 ###
turned three-dimensional

### line 1090 ###
space into two dimensions...

### line 1091 ###
which turns a wormhole

### line 1092 ###
into two dimensions, a circle.

### line 1093 ###
what's a circle in three dimensions?

### line 1094 ###
- a sphere.

### line 1095 ###
- exactly.

### line 1096 ###
a spherical hole.

### line 1097 ###
but who put it there?

### line 1098 ###
who do we have to thank?

### line 1099 ###
i'm not thanking anybody

### line 1100 ###
until we get out of here in one piece, rom.

### line 1101 ###
any trick to this, doyle?

### line 1102 ###
no one knows.

### line 1103 ###
the others made it, right?

### line 1104 ###
at least some of them.

### line 1105 ###
everybody ready to say goodbye

### line 1106 ###
to our solar system?

### line 1107 ###
to our galaxy.

### line 1108 ###
here we go.

### line 1109 ###
the controls won't work here.

### line 1110 ###
we're passing through the bulk.

### line 1111 ###
it's space beyond our three dimensions.

### line 1112 ###
all you can do is record and observe.

### line 1113 ###
what is that?

### line 1114 ###
i think it's them.

### line 1115 ###
distorting space-time.

### line 1116 ###
don't! don't!

### line 1117 ###
what was that?

### line 1118 ###
the first handshake.

### line 1119 ###
we're...

### line 1120 ###
we're here.

### line 1121 ###
so the lost communications came through.

### line 1122 ###
- how?

### line 1123 ###
- the relay on this side cached them.

### line 1124 ###
so years of basic data. no real surprises.

### line 1125 ###
miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,

### line 1126 ###
as has dr. mann's. um...

### line 1127 ###
edmunds' went down three years ago.

### line 1128 ###
transmitter failure?

### line 1129 ###
maybe. he was sending the thumbs up

### line 1130 ###
right until it went dark.

### line 1131 ###
but miller's still looks

### line 1132 ###
good though, right?

### line 1133 ###
- because she's coming up fast.

### line 1134 ###
mm-hm.

### line 1135 ###
with one complication.

### line 1136 ###
the planet is much closer to gargantua

### line 1137 ###
than we thought.

### line 1138 ###
- gargantua?

### line 1139 ###
- it's what we're calling the black hole.

### line 1140 ###
miller's and dr. mann's

### line 1141 ###
planets both orbit it.

### line 1142 ###
- and miller's is on the horizon?

### line 1143 ###
- as a basketball around a hoop.

### line 1144 ###
landing there takes us dangerously close.

### line 1145 ###
and a black hole that big

### line 1146 ###
has a huge gravitational pull.

### line 1147 ###
look, i could swing around that

### line 1148 ###
neutron star to decelerate.

### line 1149 ###
no, it's not that. it's time.

### line 1150 ###
the gravity on that planet will slow our

### line 1151 ###
clock compared to earth's drastically.

### line 1152 ###
how bad?

### line 1153 ###
every hour we spend on

### line 1154 ###
that planet will be...

### line 1155 ###
seven years back on earth.

### line 1156 ###
jesus.

### line 1157 ###
well, that's relativity, folks.

### line 1158 ###
well, we can't just drop down

### line 1159 ###
there without...

### line 1160 ###
cooper, we have a mission.

### line 1161 ###
yeah, doyle, we have a mission,

### line 1162 ###
and our mission plan a is...

### line 1163 ###
to find a planet that can habitate

### line 1164 ###
the people that are living on earth now.

### line 1165 ###
you can't just think about your family.

### line 1166 ###
now you have to think bigger.

### line 1167 ###
i am thinking about my family

### line 1168 ###
and millions of other families, okay?

### line 1169 ###
plan a does not work if the people on earth

### line 1170 ###
are dead by the time we pull it off.

### line 1171 ###
no. it doesn't.

### line 1172 ###
that's why there's a plan b.

### line 1173 ###
okay. cooper's right.

### line 1174 ###
we need to think of time

### line 1175 ###
as a resource, like

### line 1176 ###
oxygen and food. going

### line 1177 ###
down will cost us.

### line 1178 ###
all right, look.

### line 1179 ###
dr. mann's data is promising,

### line 1180 ###
but it will take months to get there.

### line 1181 ###
and edmunds', it's even further.

### line 1182 ###
miller hasn't sent much,

### line 1183 ###
but what she has is

### line 1184 ###
very promising. it's

### line 1185 ###
water, it's organics...

### line 1186 ###
- you don't find that every day.

### line 1187 ###
- no, you don't.

### line 1188 ###
and just think about the resources,

### line 1189 ###
including time...

### line 1190 ###
that would be spent

### line 1191 ###
trying to get back here.

### line 1192 ###
- romilly...

### line 1193 ###
- yeah?

### line 1194 ###
how far off from miller's planet do we

### line 1195 ###
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

### line 1196 ###
just back from the cusp.

### line 1197 ###
all right, which is here,

### line 1198 ###
just outside of miller's planet.

### line 1199 ###
- right.

### line 1200 ###
- okay.

### line 1201 ###
here's gargantua. here's miller's planet.

### line 1202 ###
instead of taking the endurance into orbit

### line 1203 ###
around miller's planet...

### line 1204 ###
which would conserve fuel,

### line 1205 ###
but we would lose a lot of time...

### line 1206 ###
what if we take a wider orbit around

### line 1207 ###
gargantua, parallel with miller's planet...

### line 1208 ###
outside of this time shift, to here?

### line 1209 ###
then we take the ranger down,

### line 1210 ###
we get miller, we get her samples.

### line 1211 ###
we come back, we analyse, we debrief.

### line 1212 ###
we're in, we're out.

### line 1213 ###
we lose a little fuel,

### line 1214 ###
but we save a whole lot of time.

### line 1215 ###
- that'll work.

### line 1216 ###
- that's good.

### line 1217 ###
there's no time for monkey business

### line 1218 ###
or chit-chat down there.

### line 1219 ###
so, tars, you should definitely stay here.

### line 1220 ###
case, you're with me. anyone else can stay.

### line 1221 ###
if we're talking about a couple years,

### line 1222 ###
i could use the time to research gravity.

### line 1223 ###
observations from the wormhole,

### line 1224 ###
that's gold to professor brand.

### line 1225 ###
tars, factor an orbit of gargantua.

### line 1226 ###
conserve fuel, minimise thrusting, but make

### line 1227 ###
sure we stay in range of miller's planet.

### line 1228 ###
- you got it?

### line 1229 ###
- i wouldn't leave you behind...

### line 1230 ###
dr. brand.

### line 1231 ###
- you ready, case?

### line 1232 ###
- yup.

### line 1233 ###
- you don't say much, do you?

### line 1234 ###
- tars talks plenty for both of us.

### line 1235 ###
detach.

### line 1236 ###
- romilly, are you reading these forces?

### line 1237 ###
it's unbelievable.

### line 1238 ###
a literal heart of darkness.

### line 1239 ###
if we could just see

### line 1240 ###
the collapsed star inside...

### line 1241 ###
the singularity, yeah,

### line 1242 ###
we'd solve gravity.

### line 1243 ###
- and we can't get anything from it?

### line 1244 ###
- nothing escapes that horizon.

### line 1245 ###
not even light.

### line 1246 ###
the answer's there,

### line 1247 ###
just no way to see it.

### line 1248 ###
there's miller's planet.

### line 1249 ###
goodbye, ranger.

### line 1250 ###
this is fast for atmospheric entry.

### line 1251 ###
- should we use the thrusters to slow?

### line 1252 ###
- no.

### line 1253 ###
i'm gonna use the ranger's aerodynamics

### line 1254 ###
to save some fuel.

### line 1255 ###
air brake?

### line 1256 ###
- we want to get down fast, don't we?

### line 1257 ###
- we want to get there in one piece.

### line 1258 ###
- hang on.

### line 1259 ###
- brand, doyle, get ready.

### line 1260 ###
- we should ease!

### line 1261 ###
- hands where i can see them.

### line 1262 ###
the only time i went down was when a

### line 1263 ###
machine was easing at the wrong time.

### line 1264 ###
a little caution...

### line 1265 ###
can get you killed,

### line 1266 ###
like reckless driving.

### line 1267 ###
- cooper, it's too damn fast!

### line 1268 ###
- i got this.

### line 1269 ###
- should i disable the feedback?

### line 1270 ###
- no. i need to feel the air.

### line 1271 ###
here we go.

### line 1272 ###
it's just water!

### line 1273 ###
the stuff of life.

### line 1274 ###
twelve hundred metres.

### line 1275 ###
- do we have a fix on the beacon?

### line 1276 ###
- got it!

### line 1277 ###
- can you manoeuvre?

### line 1278 ###
- i'll need to shave some speed.

### line 1279 ###
i'm gonna spiral down on top of it.

### line 1280 ###
everybody hang on!

### line 1281 ###
seven hundred.

### line 1282 ###
on my cue, case. on my cue.

### line 1283 ###
five hundred metres.

### line 1284 ###
fire!

### line 1285 ###
very graceful.

### line 1286 ###
no.

### line 1287 ###
but very efficient.

### line 1288 ###
what are you waiting for? let's go!

### line 1289 ###
go, go, go!

### line 1290 ###
seven years per hour here.

### line 1291 ###
let's make it count!

### line 1292 ###
this way.

### line 1293 ###
about 200 metres.

### line 1294 ###
the gravity's punishing.

### line 1295 ###
been floating through space too long?

### line 1296 ###
one hundred and thirty percent

### line 1297 ###
earth gravity.

### line 1298 ###
come on. come on.

### line 1299 ###
- there's nothing here.

### line 1300 ###
- should be right here.

### line 1301 ###
if the signal's coming from here, then...

### line 1302 ###
her beacon.

### line 1303 ###
wreckage.

### line 1304 ###
where's the rest?

### line 1305 ###
towards the mountains!

### line 1306 ###
those aren't mountains.

### line 1307 ###
they're waves.

### line 1308 ###
oh, shit. oh, shit. oh, shit.

### line 1309 ###
that one's moving away from us.

### line 1310 ###
we need the recorder.

### line 1311 ###
brand, doyle, back to the ranger now!

### line 1312 ###
we're not leaving without her data.

### line 1313 ###
get back here now!

### line 1314 ###
we do not have time!

### line 1315 ###
the second wave is coming!

### line 1316 ###
we're in the middle of a swell.

### line 1317 ###
no, i got it.

### line 1318 ###
get your ass back to the ranger now!

### line 1319 ###
brand, get back here now!

### line 1320 ###
no, cooper, go. cooper, go.

### line 1321 ###
i can't make it.

### line 1322 ###
- go!

### line 1323 ###
- case, go get her.

### line 1324 ###
- go!

### line 1325 ###
- get up. get up, brand!

### line 1326 ###
go, go! go!

### line 1327 ###
- i'm not gonna make it!

### line 1328 ###
- yes, you are. yes, you are!

### line 1329 ###
come on, case has her!

### line 1330 ###
get back here, doyle!

### line 1331 ###
come on!

### line 1332 ###
get to the hatch!

### line 1333 ###
go, go! go!

### line 1334 ###
shit.

### line 1335 ###
manually overriding inside hatch!

### line 1336 ###
cooper! wait!

### line 1337 ###
the engines are flooded!

### line 1338 ###
i'm gonna have to shut her down.

### line 1339 ###
holy shit.

### line 1340 ###
hang on!

### line 1341 ###
case, what's the problem?

### line 1342 ###
too waterlogged. let it drain.

### line 1343 ###
goddamn it!

### line 1344 ###
- i told you to leave me! why didn't you?

### line 1345 ###
- and i told you to get your ass back here!

### line 1346 ###
- one of us was thinking about the mission!

### line 1347 ###
- you were thinking about getting home.

### line 1348 ###
i was trying to do the right thing!

### line 1349 ###
can you tell that to doyle?

### line 1350 ###
- case, how much time?

### line 1351 ###
- forty-five to an hour.

### line 1352 ###
the stuff of life, huh?

### line 1353 ###
what's this gonna cost us, brand?

### line 1354 ###
a lot. decades.

### line 1355 ###
what happened to miller?

### line 1356 ###
judging by the wreckage, she was...

### line 1357 ###
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

### line 1358 ###
how's the wreckage stayed together

### line 1359 ###
after all these years, huh?

### line 1360 ###
because of the time slippage.

### line 1361 ###
on this planet's time,

### line 1362 ###
she just landed hours ago.

### line 1363 ###
she probably just died minutes ago.

### line 1364 ###
the data doyle received was just

### line 1365 ###
the initial status echoing endlessly.

### line 1366 ###
oh, we are not prepared for this.

### line 1367 ###
you eggheads have the survival skills

### line 1368 ###
of a boy scout troop.

### line 1369 ###
well, we got this far on our brains.

### line 1370 ###
farther than any human in history.

### line 1371 ###
well, not far enough!

### line 1372 ###
and now we're stuck here till there

### line 1373 ###
won't be anyone left on earth to save.

### line 1374 ###
i'm counting every minute,

### line 1375 ###
same as you, cooper.

### line 1376 ###
is there any possibility...

### line 1377 ###
some kind of a way

### line 1378 ###
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

### line 1379 ###
gain back the years?

### line 1380 ###
don't shake your head at me.

### line 1381 ###
time is relative, okay?

### line 1382 ###
it can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

### line 1383 ###
it can't run backwards. it just can't.

### line 1384 ###
the only thing that can move across

### line 1385 ###
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

### line 1386 ###
okay.

### line 1387 ###
the beings that led us here,

### line 1388 ###
they communicate...

### line 1389 ###
- through gravity, right?

### line 1390 ###
- yes.

### line 1391 ###
could they be talking

### line 1392 ###
to us from the future?

### line 1393 ###
- maybe.

### line 1394 ###
- okay. if they can...

### line 1395 ###
"they" are beings of five dimensions.

### line 1396 ###
to them, time might be

### line 1397 ###
another physical dimension.

### line 1398 ###
to them...

### line 1399 ###
the past might be a canyon

### line 1400 ###
that they can climb into and the future...

### line 1401 ###
a mountain they can climb up.

### line 1402 ###
but to us, it's not, okay?

### line 1403 ###
look, cooper, i screwed up. i'm sorry.

### line 1404 ###
but you knew about relativity.

### line 1405 ###
oh.

### line 1406 ###
brand...

### line 1407 ###
my daughter was 10 years old.

### line 1408 ###
i couldn't teach her

### line 1409 ###
einstein's theories before i left.

### line 1410 ###
couldn't you have told her

### line 1411 ###
you were going to save the world?

### line 1412 ###
no.

### line 1413 ###
when you become a parent,

### line 1414 ###
one thing becomes really clear.

### line 1415 ###
and that is that you want to make sure

### line 1416 ###
your children feel safe.

### line 1417 ###
and it rules out telling a 10-year-old

### line 1418 ###
that the world is ending.

### line 1419 ###
cooper?

### line 1420 ###
- how long for the engines, case?

### line 1421 ###
- a minute or two.

### line 1422 ###
we don't have it. helmets on!

### line 1423 ###
brand, co-pilot, you're up.

### line 1424 ###
case, blow the cabin oxygen

### line 1425 ###
through the main thrusters!

### line 1426 ###
- we're gonna spark it.

### line 1427 ###
- roger that.

### line 1428 ###
- locked.

### line 1429 ###
- depressurising.

### line 1430 ###
engines up!

### line 1431 ###
hello, rom.

### line 1432 ###
i've waited years.

### line 1433 ###
how...? how many years?

### line 1434 ###
- by now it must be...

### line 1435 ###
twenty-three years...

### line 1436 ###
four months, eight days.

### line 1437 ###
doyle?

### line 1438 ###
i thought i was prepared.

### line 1439 ###
i knew the theory.

### line 1440 ###
reality's different.

### line 1441 ###
and miller?

### line 1442 ###
there's nothing here for us.

### line 1443 ###
why didn't you sleep?

### line 1444 ###
oh, i had a couple of stretches. but i

### line 1445 ###
stopped believing you were coming back.

### line 1446 ###
and something seemed wrong

### line 1447 ###
about dreaming my life away.

### line 1448 ###
i learned what i could

### line 1449 ###
from the black hole...

### line 1450 ###
but i couldn't send

### line 1451 ###
anything to your father.

### line 1452 ###
we've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

### line 1453 ###
- is he alive?

### line 1454 ###
- oh, yeah.

### line 1455 ###
- yeah?

### line 1456 ###
- yeah.

### line 1457 ###
we've got years of messages stored.

### line 1458 ###
cooper.

### line 1459 ###
messages span 23 years.

### line 1460 ###
play it from the beginning.

### line 1461 ###
hey, dad.

### line 1462 ###
checking in. saying hi.

### line 1463 ###
um... finished second in school.

### line 1464 ###
miss kurling's still giving me c's though.

### line 1465 ###
pulled me down, but second's not bad.

### line 1466 ###
grandpa attended the ceremony.

### line 1467 ###
um... oh.

### line 1468 ###
i met another girl, dad.

### line 1469 ###
i, uh...

### line 1470 ###
i really think this is the one.

### line 1471 ###
name's lois. that's her right there.

### line 1472 ###
murphy stole grandpa's car.

### line 1473 ###
she crashed it. she's okay, though.

### line 1474 ###
hey, dad.

### line 1475 ###
look at this!

### line 1476 ###
you're a grandpa.

### line 1477 ###
his name's jesse.

### line 1478 ###
i kind of wanted to call him coop,

### line 1479 ###
but lois says, uh, maybe next time.

### line 1480 ###
donald says he's already earned the "great"

### line 1481 ###
part, so we just leave it at that.

### line 1482 ###
oh, dear. oh, dear.

### line 1483 ###
say "bye-bye, grandpa."

### line 1484 ###
bye-bye, grandpa. okay.

### line 1485 ###
sorry it's been a while.

### line 1486 ###
just...

### line 1487 ###
what with jesse and all.

### line 1488 ###
uh...

### line 1489 ###
grandpa died last week.

### line 1490 ###
we buried him out in the back forty

### line 1491 ###
next to mom and...

### line 1492 ###
jesse.

### line 1493 ###
which is where we would have buried you

### line 1494 ###
if you'd ever...

### line 1495 ###
come back.

### line 1496 ###
murph was there at the funeral.

### line 1497 ###
we don't see her that much,

### line 1498 ###
but she came for that.

### line 1499 ###
you aren't listening to this, i know that.

### line 1500 ###
all these messages are just, like...

### line 1501 ###
drifting out there in the darkness.

### line 1502 ###
lois says that, uh...

### line 1503 ###
i have to let you go.

### line 1504 ###
and, uh...

### line 1505 ###
so...

### line 1506 ###
i guess i'm letting you go.

### line 1507 ###
i don't know where you are, dad...

### line 1508 ###
but i hope that you're at peace.

### line 1509 ###
goodbye.

### line 1510 ###
hey, dad.

### line 1511 ###
hey, murph.

### line 1512 ###
you son of a bitch.

### line 1513 ###
i never made one of these

### line 1514 ###
when you were still responding...

### line 1515 ###
because i was so mad at you for leaving.

### line 1516 ###
and then when you went quiet, it...

### line 1517 ###
seemed like i should live

### line 1518 ###
with that decision. and i have.

### line 1519 ###
but today's my birthday.

### line 1520 ###
and it's a special one,

### line 1521 ###
because you told me...

### line 1522 ###
you once told me that when you came back,

### line 1523 ###
we might be the same age.

### line 1524 ###
and today i'm the age you were

### line 1525 ###
when you left.

### line 1526 ###
so it would be a real good time

### line 1527 ###
for you to come back.

### line 1528 ###
i didn't mean to intrude. it's just that

### line 1529 ###
i've never seen you in here before.

### line 1530 ###
i've never been in here before.

### line 1531 ###
i talk to amelia all the time.

### line 1532 ###
it helps.

### line 1533 ###
- i'm glad you've started.

### line 1534 ###
- i haven't. i...

### line 1535 ###
i just had something i needed to get out.

### line 1536 ###
- i know they're still out there.

### line 1537 ###
- i know.

### line 1538 ###
there are so many reasons their

### line 1539 ###
communications might not

### line 1540 ###
be getting through.

### line 1541 ###
i know, professor.

### line 1542 ###
i'm not sure what i'm more afraid of.

### line 1543 ###
them never coming back or...

### line 1544 ###
coming back to find we've failed.

### line 1545 ###
then let's succeed.

### line 1546 ###
so...

### line 1547 ###
back to the fourth iteration.

### line 1548 ###
let's run it through some new fields.

### line 1549 ###
with respect, professor,

### line 1550 ###
we've tried that hundreds of times.

### line 1551 ###
it only has to work once, murph.

### line 1552 ###
every rivet that they strike

### line 1553 ###
could have been a bullet.

### line 1554 ###
we've done well for the world here...

### line 1555 ###
whether or not we crack the equation

### line 1556 ###
before i kick the bucket.

### line 1557 ###
- don't be morbid, professor.

### line 1558 ###
- i'm not afraid of death.

### line 1559 ###
i'm an old physicist.

### line 1560 ###
i'm afraid of time.

### line 1561 ###
time.

### line 1562 ###
you're afraid of time.

### line 1563 ###
we've been trying to solve the equation...

### line 1564 ###
without changing

### line 1565 ###
the underlying assumption about time.

### line 1566 ###
- and?

### line 1567 ###
- and that means...

### line 1568 ###
each iteration is an attempt

### line 1569 ###
to prove its own proof.

### line 1570 ###
it's recursive. it's nonsensical.

### line 1571 ###
are you calling my life's work...

### line 1572 ###
nonsense, murph?

### line 1573 ###
no, i'm saying that

### line 1574 ###
you've been trying to...

### line 1575 ###
finish it with one arm... no, with

### line 1576 ###
both arms... tied behind your back.

### line 1577 ###
and i don't understand why.

### line 1578 ###
i'm an old man, murph.

### line 1579 ###
can we take this point up at another time?

### line 1580 ###
i want to talk to my daughter.

### line 1581 ###
stepping out into the universe...

### line 1582 ###
we must confront the reality

### line 1583 ###
of interstellar travel.

### line 1584 ###
we must reach far beyond

### line 1585 ###
our own lifespans.

### line 1586 ###
we must think not as individuals

### line 1587 ###
but as a species.

### line 1588 ###
do not go gentle into that good night

### line 1589 ###
tars kept the endurance

### line 1590 ###
right where we needed her.

### line 1591 ###
but the trip took years longer

### line 1592 ###
than we anticipated.

### line 1593 ###
we no longer have the fuel

### line 1594 ###
to visit both prospects, so...

### line 1595 ###
we have to choose.

### line 1596 ###
but how?

### line 1597 ###
they're both promising.

### line 1598 ###
edmunds' data is better, but dr. mann

### line 1599 ###
is the one still transmitting, so...

### line 1600 ###
we've no reason to suspect

### line 1601 ###
edmunds's data would have soured.

### line 1602 ###
his world has key elements

### line 1603 ###
to sustain human life.

### line 1604 ###
- as does dr. mann's.

### line 1605 ###
- cooper, this is my field.

### line 1606 ###
and...

### line 1607 ###
i really believe edmunds'

### line 1608 ###
is the better prospect.

### line 1609 ###
- why?

### line 1610 ###
- gargantua, that's why.

### line 1611 ###
look at miller's planet.

### line 1612 ###
hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

### line 1613 ###
but no life. sterile.

### line 1614 ###
we'll find the same thing on mann's.

### line 1615 ###
because of the black hole?

### line 1616 ###
murphy's law.

### line 1617 ###
whatever can happen will happen.

### line 1618 ###
accident is the first building block

### line 1619 ###
of evolution.

### line 1620 ###
but when you're orbiting a black hole

### line 1621 ###
not enough can happen.

### line 1622 ###
it sucks in asteroids and comets, other

### line 1623 ###
events which would otherwise reach you.

### line 1624 ###
we need to go further afield.

### line 1625 ###
you once said that dr. mann...

### line 1626 ###
was the best of us.

### line 1627 ###
he's remarkable.

### line 1628 ###
we're only here because of him.

### line 1629 ###
and yet...

### line 1630 ###
yet here he is.

### line 1631 ###
he's on the ground, and he's sending

### line 1632 ###
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

### line 1633 ###
to come to his planet.

### line 1634 ###
granted, but edmunds' data

### line 1635 ###
is more promising.

### line 1636 ###
we should vote.

### line 1637 ###
well, if we vote,

### line 1638 ###
there's something you should know.

### line 1639 ###
brand?

### line 1640 ###
he has a right to know.

### line 1641 ###
that has nothing to do with it.

### line 1642 ###
- what does?

### line 1643 ###
- she's in love with wolf edmunds.

### line 1644 ###
- is that true?

### line 1645 ###
- yes.

### line 1646 ###
and that makes me want to follow my heart.

### line 1647 ###
but maybe we've spent too long

### line 1648 ###
trying to figure all this out with theory.

### line 1649 ###
you're a scientist, brand.

### line 1650 ###
so listen to me...

### line 1651 ###
when i say that love

### line 1652 ###
isn't something we invented. it's...

### line 1653 ###
observable, powerful.

### line 1654 ###
it has to mean something.

### line 1655 ###
love has meaning, yes. social utility,

### line 1656 ###
social bonding, child rearing...

### line 1657 ###
we love people who have died.

### line 1658 ###
where's the social utility in that?

### line 1659 ###
none.

### line 1660 ###
maybe it means something more,

### line 1661 ###
something we can't...

### line 1662 ###
yet understand.

### line 1663 ###
maybe it's some evidence, some...

### line 1664 ###
artefact of a higher dimension

### line 1665 ###
that we can't consciously perceive.

### line 1666 ###
i'm drawn across the universe

### line 1667 ###
to someone i haven't seen in a decade...

### line 1668 ###
who i know is probably dead.

### line 1669 ###
love is the one thing

### line 1670 ###
we're capable of perceiving...

### line 1671 ###
that transcends dimensions

### line 1672 ###
of time and space.

### line 1673 ###
maybe we should trust that,

### line 1674 ###
even if we can't understand it yet.

### line 1675 ###
all right, cooper...

### line 1676 ###
yes...

### line 1677 ###
the tiniest possibility

### line 1678 ###
of seeing wolf again excites me.

### line 1679 ###
that doesn't mean i'm wrong.

### line 1680 ###
honestly, amelia...

### line 1681 ###
it might.

### line 1682 ###
tars, chart a course for dr. mann's.

### line 1683 ###
we'll lose about a third again.

### line 1684 ###
but next year...

### line 1685 ###
next year i'm gonna work nelson's farm

### line 1686 ###
and we'll make it up.

### line 1687 ###
what happened to nelson?

### line 1688 ###
murph, would you like some more soufflé?

### line 1689 ###
oh, no. i'm full, thanks. it was delicious.

### line 1690 ###
coop, finish your fritter, please.

### line 1691 ###
will you spend the night? your room is

### line 1692 ###
exactly as you left it. it's ready.

### line 1693 ###
i need to get back.

### line 1694 ###
my sewing machine is in there,

### line 1695 ###
but there's plenty...

### line 1696 ###
i need to...

### line 1697 ###
too many memories.

### line 1698 ###
we might have something for that.

### line 1699 ###
hey, coop.

### line 1700 ###
the dust.

### line 1701 ###
lois, i have a friend who...

### line 1702 ###
could look at his lungs.

### line 1703 ###
- amelia, i'm sorry.

### line 1704 ###
- you were just being objective.

### line 1705 ###
unless you're punishing me

### line 1706 ###
for screwing up on miller's planet.

### line 1707 ###
no, this wasn't a personal decision.

### line 1708 ###
if you're wrong, you will have

### line 1709 ###
a very personal decision to make.

### line 1710 ###
your fuel calculations

### line 1711 ###
are based on a return journey.

### line 1712 ###
strike out on mann's planet, and we'll have

### line 1713 ###
to decide whether to return home...

### line 1714 ###
or push on to edmunds' with plan b.

### line 1715 ###
starting a colony could save us

### line 1716 ###
from extinction.

### line 1717 ###
you might have to decide

### line 1718 ###
between seeing your children again...

### line 1719 ###
and the future of the human race.

### line 1720 ###
i trust you'll be as objective then.

### line 1721 ###
he's been asking for you since he came to.

### line 1722 ###
we were trying to reach you.

### line 1723 ###
murph.

### line 1724 ###
i'm here, professor.

### line 1725 ###
i let you all down.

### line 1726 ###
no, you got us so far. real close.

### line 1727 ###
i'll finish what you started.

### line 1728 ###
good, good murph.

### line 1729 ###
you had faith...

### line 1730 ###
all those...

### line 1731 ###
all those years.

### line 1732 ###
i... i asked you to have faith.

### line 1733 ###
i wanted you to believe...

### line 1734 ###
that your father...

### line 1735 ###
would come back.

### line 1736 ###
i do, professor.

### line 1737 ###
forgive me, murph.

### line 1738 ###
there's nothing to forgive.

### line 1739 ###
i...

### line 1740 ###
i lied, murph.

### line 1741 ###
i lied to you.

### line 1742 ###
there was no need for him to...

### line 1743 ###
to come back.

### line 1744 ###
there is no way to help us.

### line 1745 ###
but plan a...

### line 1746 ###
all this. all these people.

### line 1747 ###
and the equation.

### line 1748 ###
did my father know?

### line 1749 ###
did he leave me?

### line 1750 ###
do...

### line 1751 ###
not...

### line 1752 ###
go...

### line 1753 ###
gentle...

### line 1754 ###
no.

### line 1755 ###
no!

### line 1756 ###
you can't leave.

### line 1757 ###
you... no.

### line 1758 ###
dr. brand, i'm sorry to tell you that

### line 1759 ###
your father died today. he had no pain.

### line 1760 ###
he was at peace.

### line 1761 ###
i'm very sorry for your loss.

### line 1762 ###
brand, did you know?

### line 1763 ###
he told you, right?

### line 1764 ###
you knew.

### line 1765 ###
this was all a sham.

### line 1766 ###
you left us here.

### line 1767 ###
to suffocate.

### line 1768 ###
to starve.

### line 1769 ###
frozen cloud.

### line 1770 ###
it's okay.

### line 1771 ###
it's okay.

### line 1772 ###
it's okay.

### line 1773 ###
pray you never learn...

### line 1774 ###
just how good it can be

### line 1775 ###
to see another face.

### line 1776 ###
i hadn't a lot of hope

### line 1777 ###
to begin with, but...

### line 1778 ###
after so long, i had none.

### line 1779 ###
my supplies were completely exhausted.

### line 1780 ###
the last time i went to sleep,

### line 1781 ###
i didn't even set a waking date.

### line 1782 ###
you have literally raised me from the dead.

### line 1783 ###
- lazarus.

### line 1784 ###
- hm.

### line 1785 ###
- what about the others?

### line 1786 ###
- i'm afraid you're it, sir.

### line 1787 ###
so far, surely.

### line 1788 ###
no, our present situation is that there's

### line 1789 ###
very little chance of rescuing any others.

### line 1790 ###
dr. mann. dr. mann?

### line 1791 ###
tell us about your world.

### line 1792 ###
our world, we hope.

### line 1793 ###
our world, uh, is cold...

### line 1794 ###
stark...

### line 1795 ###
but undeniably beautiful.

### line 1796 ###
the days are 67 hours long, cold.

### line 1797 ###
the nights are... 67

### line 1798 ###
far colder hours.

### line 1799 ###
the gravity is a very, very pleasant

### line 1800 ###
now, up here where i landed,

### line 1801 ###
the water is alkali...

### line 1802 ###
and the air has too much ammonia to

### line 1803 ###
breathe for more than just a few minutes...

### line 1804 ###
but down at the surface,

### line 1805 ###
and there is a surface...

### line 1806 ###
the chlorine dissipates.

### line 1807 ###
the ammonia gives way to crystalline

### line 1808 ###
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

### line 1809 ###
to organics.

### line 1810 ###
possibly even to life.

### line 1811 ###
we might be sharing this world.

### line 1812 ###
these readings are from the surface?

### line 1813 ###
over the years, i've

### line 1814 ###
dropped various probes.

### line 1815 ###
- how far have you explored?

### line 1816 ###
- i've mounted several major expeditions.

### line 1817 ###
but with oxygen in limited supply,

### line 1818 ###
kipp there really did most of the legwork.

### line 1819 ###
- what went wrong with him, sir?

### line 1820 ###
- degeneration.

### line 1821 ###
he misidentified the first organics

### line 1822 ###
we found as ammonia crystals.

### line 1823 ###
we struggled on for a time,

### line 1824 ###
but ultimately i decommissioned him and...

### line 1825 ###
used his power source

### line 1826 ###
to keep the mission going.

### line 1827 ###
i thought i was alone

### line 1828 ###
before i shut him down.

### line 1829 ###
would you like me to look at him?

### line 1830 ###
no. no. he needs a human touch.

### line 1831 ###
dr. brand, case is relaying a message

### line 1832 ###
for you from the comm station.

### line 1833 ###
okay. be right there. excuse me.

### line 1834 ###
dr. brand, i'm sorry to tell you

### line 1835 ###
that your father died today.

### line 1836 ###
he had no pain.

### line 1837 ###
he was at peace.

### line 1838 ###
i'm sorry for your loss.

### line 1839 ###
is that murph?

### line 1840 ###
she's... she's grown.

### line 1841 ###
brand, did you know?

### line 1842 ###
he told you, right?

### line 1843 ###
you knew.

### line 1844 ###
this was all a sham.

### line 1845 ###
you left us here.

### line 1846 ###
to suffocate.

### line 1847 ###
to starve.

### line 1848 ###
did my father know too?

### line 1849 ###
dad?

### line 1850 ###
i just want to know...

### line 1851 ###
if you left me here to die.

### line 1852 ###
i just have to know.

### line 1853 ###
cooper, my...

### line 1854 ###
my father dedicated...

### line 1855 ###
his whole life to plan a.

### line 1856 ###
i have no idea what she's talking about.

### line 1857 ###
i do.

### line 1858 ###
he never even hoped

### line 1859 ###
to get the people off the earth?

### line 1860 ###
no.

### line 1861 ###
but he's been trying to solve

### line 1862 ###
the gravity equation for 40 years.

### line 1863 ###
amelia, your father solved his equation

### line 1864 ###
before i even left.

### line 1865 ###
then why wouldn't he use it?

### line 1866 ###
the equation couldn't reconcile relativity

### line 1867 ###
with quantum mechanics. you need more.

### line 1868 ###
more? more what?

### line 1869 ###
more data. you need

### line 1870 ###
to see into a black hole.

### line 1871 ###
the laws of nature prohibit

### line 1872 ###
a naked singularity.

### line 1873 ###
romilly, is that true?

### line 1874 ###
if a black hole is an oyster,

### line 1875 ###
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

### line 1876 ###
the gravity's so strong,

### line 1877 ###
it's always hidden in darkness...

### line 1878 ###
behind the horizon.

### line 1879 ###
that's why we call it a black hole.

### line 1880 ###
okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...

### line 1881 ###
we can't, coop.

### line 1882 ###
there are some things

### line 1883 ###
that aren't meant to be known.

### line 1884 ###
your father had to find another way

### line 1885 ###
to save the human race from extinction.

### line 1886 ###
plan b. a colony.

### line 1887 ###
why not tell people?

### line 1888 ###
- why keep building those stations?

### line 1889 ###
- he knew how hard it would be...

### line 1890 ###
to get people to work together

### line 1891 ###
to save the species instead of themselves.

### line 1892 ###
or their children.

### line 1893 ###
bullshit.

### line 1894 ###
you never would've come

### line 1895 ###
unless you believed you would save them.

### line 1896 ###
evolution has yet to transcend

### line 1897 ###
that simple barrier.

### line 1898 ###
we can care deeply, selflessly about...

### line 1899 ###
those we know, but that empathy

### line 1900 ###
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

### line 1901 ###
but the lie.

### line 1902 ###
that monstrous lie?

### line 1903 ###
unforgivable.

### line 1904 ###
and he knew that.

### line 1905 ###
he was prepared to destroy his own humanity

### line 1906 ###
in order to save the species.

### line 1907 ###
- he made an incredible sacrifice.

### line 1908 ###
- no.

### line 1909 ###
an incredible sacrifice is being made

### line 1910 ###
by the people on earth who are gonna die!

### line 1911 ###
because in his fucking arrogance...

### line 1912 ###
he declared their case hopeless.

### line 1913 ###
i'm sorry, cooper...

### line 1914 ###
their case is hopeless.

### line 1915 ###
no. no.

### line 1916 ###
we are the future.

### line 1917 ###
cooper, what can i do?

### line 1918 ###
let me go home.

### line 1919 ###
you're absolutely positive?

### line 1920 ###
his solution was correct.

### line 1921 ###
he'd had it for years.

### line 1922 ###
- it's worthless?

### line 1923 ###
- it's half the answer.

### line 1924 ###
okay, how do you find the other half?

### line 1925 ###
out there? a black hole.

### line 1926 ###
- but stuck down here on earth?

### line 1927 ###
- yeah?

### line 1928 ###
i'm not sure you can.

### line 1929 ###
god, they just pack up and leave.

### line 1930 ###
what are they hoping to find?

### line 1931 ###
survival.

### line 1932 ###
damn it.

### line 1933 ###
murph, don't...?

### line 1934 ###
don't people have a right to know?

### line 1935 ###
panic won't help.

### line 1936 ###
we just have to keep working, same as ever.

### line 1937 ###
but isn't that exactly what professor brand

### line 1938 ###
was manipulating us to do?

### line 1939 ###
brand gave up on us.

### line 1940 ###
i'm still trying to solve this.

### line 1941 ###
so...

### line 1942 ###
do you have an idea?

### line 1943 ###
a feeling.

### line 1944 ###
i told you about my ghost.

### line 1945 ###
my dad thought i called it a ghost...

### line 1946 ###
because i was scared of it.

### line 1947 ###
but i was never scared of it.

### line 1948 ###
i called it a ghost because it felt...

### line 1949 ###
it felt like a person.

### line 1950 ###
it was trying to tell me something.

### line 1951 ###
if there's an answer here on earth,

### line 1952 ###
it's back there...

### line 1953 ###
somehow, in that room.

### line 1954 ###
so i have to find it.

### line 1955 ###
we're running out of time.

### line 1956 ###
what about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

### line 1957 ###
no, they can stay.

### line 1958 ###
i'll be sleeping anyway.

### line 1959 ###
- hey, coop?

### line 1960 ###
- yeah?

### line 1961 ###
i have a suggestion for

### line 1962 ###
your return journey.

### line 1963 ###
- yeah, what's that?

### line 1964 ###
- have one last crack at the black hole.

### line 1965 ###
i'm going home, rom.

### line 1966 ###
yeah, i know.

### line 1967 ###
this isn't going to cost you any time.

### line 1968 ###
there's a chance for the people on earth.

### line 1969 ###
- talk to me.

### line 1970 ###
- gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

### line 1971 ###
- it's what we call a gentle singularity.

### line 1972 ###
- gentle?

### line 1973 ###
they're hardly gentle.

### line 1974 ###
but the tidal gravity is so quick that...

### line 1975 ###
something crossing the horizon fast

### line 1976 ###
might survive. a probe, say.

### line 1977 ###
- what happens after it crosses?

### line 1978 ###
- after the horizon is a complete mystery.

### line 1979 ###
so, what's to say

### line 1980 ###
there isn't some way that the probe...

### line 1981 ###
can glimpse the singularity

### line 1982 ###
and relay the quantum data?

### line 1983 ###
if he's equipped to transmit

### line 1984 ###
every form of energy that can pulse.

### line 1985 ###
just when did this probe

### line 1986 ###
become a "he," professor?

### line 1987 ###
tars is the obvious candidate.

### line 1988 ###
i've already told him what to look for.

### line 1989 ###
i'd need the old optical transmitter

### line 1990 ###
off kipp, cooper.

### line 1991 ###
you'd do this for us?

### line 1992 ###
before you get all teary, remember that

### line 1993 ###
as a robot i have to do anything you say.

### line 1994 ###
your cue light's broken.

### line 1995 ###
i'm not joking.

### line 1996 ###
i'll need tars to remove and adapt

### line 1997 ###
some components from kipp.

### line 1998 ###
i don't want to disturb

### line 1999 ###
his archival functions.

### line 2000 ###
i'll supervise.

### line 2001 ###
all right.

### line 2002 ###
dr. mann, we need to

### line 2003 ###
find three secure

### line 2004 ###
sites. one for brand's

### line 2005 ###
lab, two for habitat.

### line 2006 ###
once those modules have landed,

### line 2007 ###
you don't want to move them.

### line 2008 ###
i can take you to the probe sites,

### line 2009 ###
but i don't think...

### line 2010 ###
these conditions will hold.

### line 2011 ###
i think we should wait.

### line 2012 ###
case is headed down

### line 2013 ###
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

### line 2014 ###
i'd really like to secure

### line 2015 ###
those sites by nightfall.

### line 2016 ###
well, these squalls do usually blow over.

### line 2017 ###
okay, then.

### line 2018 ###
- you'll need a long-range transmitter.

### line 2019 ###
- got it.

### line 2020 ###
- are you charged?

### line 2021 ###
- yeah.

### line 2022 ###
follow me.

### line 2023 ###
tars, 72 hours, yeah?

### line 2024 ###
roger that, cooper.

### line 2025 ###
brand told me why you feel

### line 2026 ###
you have to go back.

### line 2027 ###
but i'd be remiss

### line 2028 ###
if i didn't at least mention...

### line 2029 ###
that a mission such as ours

### line 2030 ###
could certainly use an extra engineer.

### line 2031 ###
you better slow down, turbo.

### line 2032 ###
safety first, case, remember.

### line 2033 ###
safety first, cooper.

### line 2034 ###
i have to tell you, dr. mann,

### line 2035 ###
i'm honoured to be a part of this.

### line 2036 ###
but once we set up base camp and secure

### line 2037 ###
those modules, my work's done here.

### line 2038 ###
i'm going home.

### line 2039 ###
you have attachments.

### line 2040 ###
but even without a family...

### line 2041 ###
i can promise you that that yearning

### line 2042 ###
to be with other people is powerful.

### line 2043 ###
that emotion is at the foundation...

### line 2044 ###
of what makes us human.

### line 2045 ###
it's not to be taken lightly.

### line 2046 ###
- how long have you had that cough?

### line 2047 ###
- a while.

### line 2048 ###
mom lets me play in here.

### line 2049 ###
i don't touch your stuff.

### line 2050 ###
just take this gently.

### line 2051 ###
you know why we couldn't just send machines

### line 2052 ###
on these missions, don't you?

### line 2053 ###
a machine doesn't improvise well

### line 2054 ###
because you can't program a fear of death.

### line 2055 ###
our survival instinct is

### line 2056 ###
our single greatest...

### line 2057 ###
source of inspiration.

### line 2058 ###
take you, for example.

### line 2059 ###
a father...

### line 2060 ###
with a survival instinct

### line 2061 ###
that extends to your kids.

### line 2062 ###
what does research tell us is the last

### line 2063 ###
thing you're going to see before you die?

### line 2064 ###
your children. their faces.

### line 2065 ###
at the moment of death,

### line 2066 ###
your mind's gonna push...

### line 2067 ###
a little bit harder to survive.

### line 2068 ###
for them.

### line 2069 ###
deep breath.

### line 2070 ###
uh, hey. i bet you're coop.

### line 2071 ###
why don't you have a seat here for me?

### line 2072 ###
it's bad. they cannot stay here.

### line 2073 ###
- okay?

### line 2074 ###
- yeah.

### line 2075 ###
tars, what's taking so long?

### line 2076 ###
professor, i am having trouble

### line 2077 ###
completing the boot up.

### line 2078 ###
i don't understand.

### line 2079 ###
it's funny.

### line 2080 ###
when i left earth...

### line 2081 ###
i thought i was prepared to die.

### line 2082 ###
the truth is...

### line 2083 ###
i never really considered the

### line 2084 ###
possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

### line 2085 ###
nothing worked out the way

### line 2086 ###
it was supposed to.

### line 2087 ###
let's go.

### line 2088 ###
all right, buddy, give

### line 2089 ###
me a big deep breath.

### line 2090 ###
what is this?

### line 2091 ###
what are you doing?

### line 2092 ###
i'm sorry! i can't let

### line 2093 ###
you leave with that ship.

### line 2094 ###
we're gonna need it

### line 2095 ###
to complete the mission...

### line 2096 ###
once the others realise

### line 2097 ###
what this place isn't.

### line 2098 ###
we cannot survive here. i'm sorry!

### line 2099 ###
i'm sorry!

### line 2100 ###
- they can't stay here anymore.

### line 2101 ###
- you have to leave right now.

### line 2102 ###
let me make something abundantly clear.

### line 2103 ###
you have a responsibility...

### line 2104 ###
- oh! jesus!

### line 2105 ###
- coop, get her stuff. she's going home.

### line 2106 ###
dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, tom!

### line 2107 ###
dad didn't raise me, grandpa did. and

### line 2108 ###
he's buried out back with mom and jesse.

### line 2109 ###
you faked all the data?

### line 2110 ###
yeah.

### line 2111 ###
there's no surface?

### line 2112 ###
no.

### line 2113 ###
i tried to do my duty, cooper...

### line 2114 ###
but i knew the day that i arrived here

### line 2115 ###
that this place had nothing.

### line 2116 ###
and i resisted the temptation for years...

### line 2117 ###
but i knew that...

### line 2118 ###
if i just pressed that button, then...

### line 2119 ###
somebody would come and save me.

### line 2120 ###
you fucking coward.

### line 2121 ###
yes.

### line 2122 ###
yes.

### line 2123 ###
yes.

### line 2124 ###
yes.

### line 2125 ###
listen, if you're not going to go,

### line 2126 ###
let your family go. just save your family.

### line 2127 ###
and we go live underground with you?

### line 2128 ###
pray that daddy comes to save us?

### line 2129 ###
dad's not coming back.

### line 2130 ###
he never was coming back. it's up to me.

### line 2131 ###
you're gonna save everybody?

### line 2132 ###
- because dad couldn't do it.

### line 2133 ###
- dad didn't even try!

### line 2134 ###
dad just abandoned us!

### line 2135 ###
he left us here to die.

### line 2136 ###
nobody's going with you.

### line 2137 ###
you gonna wait for your next kid to die?

### line 2138 ###
get out.

### line 2139 ###
and don't come back.

### line 2140 ###
you can keep my stuff.

### line 2141 ###
stop it!

### line 2142 ###
no. no!

### line 2143 ###
dr. mann, there's a 50-50 chance

### line 2144 ###
you're gonna kill yourself!

### line 2145 ###
those are the best odds i've had in years.

### line 2146 ###
don't judge me, cooper.

### line 2147 ###
you were never tested like i was.

### line 2148 ###
few men have been.

### line 2149 ###
you tried your best, murph.

### line 2150 ###
you're feeling it, aren't you?

### line 2151 ###
the survival instinct.

### line 2152 ###
that's what drove me. it's what drives all

### line 2153 ###
of us. and it's what's gonna save us.

### line 2154 ###
because i want to save all of us.

### line 2155 ###
for you, cooper.

### line 2156 ###
i'm sorry, i can't watch you

### line 2157 ###
go through this. i'm sorry.

### line 2158 ###
i thought i could, but i can't.

### line 2159 ###
i'm here. i'm here for you.

### line 2160 ###
just listen to my voice, cooper.

### line 2161 ###
i'm right here.

### line 2162 ###
you're not alone.

### line 2163 ###
do you see your children?

### line 2164 ###
it's okay.

### line 2165 ###
they're right there with you.

### line 2166 ###
did professor brand tell you

### line 2167 ###
that poem before you left?

### line 2168 ###
do you remember?

### line 2169 ###
do not go gentle into that good night

### line 2170 ###
old age should burn and rave

### line 2171 ###
at close of day

### line 2172 ###
rage, rage against the dying of the light

### line 2173 ###
shctf{d0_n0t_g0_g3ntle_into_that_g0od_n1ght}

### line 2174 ###
brand! help!

### line 2175 ###
- help!

### line 2176 ###
- cooper?

### line 2177 ###
case!

### line 2178 ###
no air.

### line 2179 ###
ammonia.

### line 2180 ###
cooper. cooper, we're coming! case!

### line 2181 ###
- i have a fix.

### line 2182 ###
- go! go, go, go!

### line 2183 ###
and away!

### line 2184 ###
cooper, we're coming.

### line 2185 ###
hang in there. don't talk.

### line 2186 ###
try to breathe as little as possible.

### line 2187 ###
we're almost there.

### line 2188 ###
there's a security lockout, sir.

### line 2189 ###
it requires a person to access function.

### line 2190 ###
it's all yours, sir.

### line 2191 ###
try not to breathe.

### line 2192 ###
we're coming. we're coming right now.

### line 2193 ###
case, come on! come on!

### line 2194 ###
we got to go faster, case!

### line 2195 ###
faster, faster, faster!

### line 2196 ###
hang in there. come on.

### line 2197 ###
i see him, i see him! case, bank!

### line 2198 ###
bank right!

### line 2199 ###
cooper! cooper!

### line 2200 ###
i'm here!

### line 2201 ###
this data makes no sense.

### line 2202 ###
i'm sorry.

### line 2203 ###
- what?

### line 2204 ###
- mann was lying!

### line 2205 ###
go. go.

### line 2206 ###
romilly.

### line 2207 ###
romilly!

### line 2208 ###
romilly! do you read me, romilly?

### line 2209 ###
step back, professor! step back!

### line 2210 ###
- romilly...

### line 2211 ###
- romilly, do you read me?

### line 2212 ###
keep watch!

### line 2213 ###
lois?

### line 2214 ###
- what happened to caution, case?

### line 2215 ###
- safety first, cooper.

### line 2216 ###
romilly? romilly, do you read me?

### line 2217 ###
this is brand.

### line 2218 ###
romilly?

### line 2219 ###
dr. brand. cooper.

### line 2220 ###
there's been an explosion.

### line 2221 ###
dr. mann's compound.

### line 2222 ###
tars, tars, 10 o'clock!

### line 2223 ###
let me know when tars is aboard.

### line 2224 ###
romilly did not survive.

### line 2225 ###
i could not save him.

### line 2226 ###
- tars is in.

### line 2227 ###
- i'll take her now.

### line 2228 ###
- do we have a fix on the ranger?

### line 2229 ###
- he's pushing into orbit!

### line 2230 ###
if he takes control of

### line 2231 ###
that ship, we're dead.

### line 2232 ###
- he'd maroon us?

### line 2233 ###
- he is marooning us.

### line 2234 ###
i'll meet you guys downstairs.

### line 2235 ###
go wait by the car.

### line 2236 ###
come on! give me your bag. get in the

dr. mann, please respond!

### line 2240 ###
he doesn't know

### line 2241 ###
the endurance docking procedure.

### line 2242 ###
- the autopilot does.

### line 2243 ###
- not since tars disabled it.

### line 2244 ###
nice.

### line 2245 ###
- what's your trust setting, tars?

### line 2246 ###
- lower than yours apparently.

### line 2261 ###

- imperfectly.

### line 2263 ###
dr. mann, do not...

### line 2264 ###
hatch lockout disengaged.

### line 2265 ###
dr. mann, do not,

### line 2266 ###
i repeat, do not open the hatch.

### line 2267 ###
i repeat, do not open the hatch.

### line 2268 ###
if you open the hatch,

### line 2269 ###
the airlock will depressurise.

### line 2270 ###
- what happens if he blows the airlock?

### line 2271 ###
- nothing good.

### line 2272 ###
okay, pull back. retro thrusters,

### line 2273 ###
everything we've got, case!

### line 2274 ###
- thrusters are full!

### line 2275 ###
- back!

### line 2276 ###
relay my transmission

### line 2277 ###
to the on board computer...

### line 2278 ###
and have it rebroadcast

### line 2279 ###
as emergency p.a.

### line 2280 ###
dr. mann...

### line 2281 ###
i repeat, do not open

### line 2282 ###
the inner hatch. i repeat...

### line 2283 ###
brand?

### line 2284 ###
i don't know what he said to you...

### line 2285 ###
but i am taking command

### line 2286 ###
of the endurance.

### line 2287 ###
and then we can talk

### line 2288 ###
about completing the mission.

### line 2289 ###
dr. mann, listen to me.

### line 2290 ###
this is not about my life.

### line 2291 ###
or cooper's life. this

### line 2292 ###
is about all mankind.

### line 2293 ###
there is a moment...

### line 2294 ###
it is not sa...

### line 2295 ###
oh, my god.

### line 2296 ###
there's no point using fuel to chase...

### line 2297 ###
- analyse the endurance's spin.

### line 2298 ###
- cooper, what are you doing?

### line 2299 ###
- docking.

### line 2300 ###
endurance rotation is 67, 68 rpm.

### line 2301 ###
okay, get ready to match our spin

### line 2302 ###
with the retro thrusters.

### line 2303 ###
- it's not possible.

### line 2304 ###
- no...

### line 2305 ###
it's necessary.

### line 2306 ###
endurance is hitting stratosphere!

### line 2307 ###
she's got no heat shield.

### line 2308 ###
- case, you ready?

### line 2309 ###
- ready.

### line 2310 ###
cooper! this is no time for caution.

### line 2311 ###
case, if i black out, you take the stick.

### line 2312 ###
tars, get ready to engage

### line 2313 ###
the docking mechanism.

### line 2314 ###
endurance is starting to heat.

### line 2315 ###
twenty feet out.

### line 2316 ###
i need three degrees starboard, cooper.

### line 2317 ###
ten feet out.

### line 2318 ###
cooper, we are lined up.

### line 2319 ###
initiating spin!

### line 2320 ###
come on, tars.

### line 2321 ###
come on, tars!

### line 2322 ###
- we are locked, cooper.

### line 2323 ###
- locked. easing up!

### line 2324 ###
easy.

### line 2325 ###
easy.

### line 2326 ###
retro thrusters!

### line 2327 ###
main engines on.

### line 2328 ###
pushing out of orbit. come on, baby.

### line 2329 ###
killing main engines!

### line 2330 ###
okay, we're out of orbit.

### line 2331 ###
okay. and for our next trick!

### line 2332 ###
it'll have to be good.

### line 2333 ###
we're heading into gargantua's pull.

### line 2334 ###
oh, shit.

### line 2335 ###
- case, take the stick.

### line 2336 ###
- roger that.

### line 2337 ###
cooper, we're slipping towards gargantua.

### line 2338 ###
shall i use main engines?

### line 2339 ###
no.

### line 2340 ###
we got to let her slide as far as we can.

### line 2341 ###
- give it to me.

### line 2342 ###
- there's good news, there's bad news.

### line 2343 ###
yeah, i've heard that one, tars.

### line 2344 ###
give it to me straight.

### line 2345 ###
the backup generator kicked in,

### line 2346 ###
so the system's stable. they're all good.

### line 2347 ###
good.

### line 2348 ###
okay. the navigational hub

### line 2349 ###
has been completely destroyed.

### line 2350 ###
we don't have enough life support

### line 2351 ###
to make it back to earth...

### line 2352 ###
but we can scratch our way

### line 2353 ###
to edmunds' planet.

### line 2354 ###
what about fuel?

### line 2355 ###
not enough. but i have a plan.

### line 2356 ###
we let gargantua pull us down

### line 2357 ###
close to her horizon.

### line 2358 ###
then a powered slingshot around,

### line 2359 ###
launching us towards edmunds' planet.

### line 2360 ###
- manually?

### line 2361 ###
- that's what i'm here for.

### line 2362 ###
i'm gonna take us just

### line 2363 ###
inside the critical orbit.

### line 2364 ###
- what about time slippage?

### line 2365 ###
- neither of us has time to worry...

### line 2366 ###
about relativity right now, dr. brand.

### line 2367 ###
i'm sorry, cooper.

### line 2368 ###
once we've gathered

### line 2369 ###
enough speed around gargantua...

### line 2370 ###
we use lander 1...

### line 2371 ###
and ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

### line 2372 ###
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

### line 2373 ###
the lander's linkages

### line 2374 ###
have been destroyed...

### line 2375 ###
so we'll have to control manually.

### line 2376 ###
once lander 1 is spent, tars will detach...

### line 2377 ###
and get sucked into that black hole.

### line 2378 ###
why does tars have to detach?

### line 2379 ###
we have to shed the weight

### line 2380 ###
to escape the gravity.

### line 2381 ###
newton's third law.

### line 2382 ###
the only way humans have ever

### line 2383 ###
figured out of getting somewhere...

### line 2384 ###
is to leave something behind.

### line 2385 ###
cooper, you can't ask tars

### line 2386 ###
to do this for us.

### line 2387 ###
he's a robot. so you don't have

### line 2388 ###
to ask him to do anything.

### line 2389 ###
cooper, you asshole!

### line 2390 ###
sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

### line 2391 ###
it's what we intended, dr. brand.

### line 2392 ###
it's our only chance to

### line 2393 ###
save people on earth.

### line 2394 ###
if i can find a way to transmit

### line 2395 ###
the quantum data i'll find in there...

### line 2396 ###
they might still make it.

### line 2397 ###
let's just hope

### line 2398 ###
there's still someone there to save.

### line 2399 ###
maximum velocity achieved.

### line 2400 ###
prepare to fire escape thrusters.

### line 2401 ###
ready?

### line 2402 ###
ready.

### line 2403 ###
ready.

### line 2404 ###
main engine ignition in three...

### line 2405 ###
two...

### line 2406 ###
one. mark.

### line 2407 ###
come on, baby.

### line 2408 ###
lander 1 engines, on my mark.

### line 2409 ###
three...

### line 2410 ###
two... one. mark.

### line 2411 ###
ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

### line 2412 ###
three, two, one...

### line 2413 ###
- mark.

### line 2414 ###
- fire!

### line 2415 ###
this little manoeuvre's

### line 2416 ###
gonna cost us 51 years!

### line 2417 ###
you don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

### line 2418 ###
lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

### line 2419 ###
three, two...

### line 2420 ###
one. mark.

### line 2421 ###
detach!

### line 2422 ###
- goodbye, tars.

### line 2423 ###
- goodbye, dr. brand.

### line 2424 ###
- see you on the other side, coop.

### line 2425 ###
- see you there, slick!

### line 2426 ###
okay, case.

### line 2427 ###
- nice reckless flying!

### line 2428 ###
- learned from the master.

### line 2429 ###
- ranger 2, prepare to detach.

### line 2430 ###
- what?

### line 2431 ###
no! no! cooper! what are you doing?

### line 2432 ###
newton's third law.

### line 2433 ###
you got to leave something behind.

### line 2434 ###
you told me we had enough resources

### line 2435 ###
for both of us.

### line 2436 ###
we agreed, amelia...

### line 2437 ###
don't.

### line 2438 ###
detach.

### line 2439 ###
okay, i am nosing down.

### line 2440 ###
approaching the event horizon.

### line 2441 ###
portside, dipping down beneath it...

### line 2442 ###
to go through it.

### line 2443 ###
heading towards blackness.

### line 2444 ###
i have a visual of the event.

### line 2445 ###
it's all black.

### line 2446 ###
tars, do you read me?

### line 2447 ###
it's all blackness.

### line 2448 ###
tars! do you read me? over.

### line 2449 ###
okay.

### line 2450 ###
screens...

### line 2451 ###
getting interference.

### line 2452 ###
losing control of the stick. i got flashes.

### line 2453 ###
flashes of lightness and blackness.

### line 2454 ###
the turbulence in the

### line 2455 ###
gravity is increasing.

### line 2456 ###
ah.

### line 2457 ###
the computers are going down. agh.

### line 2458 ###
gravitational pull.

### line 2459 ###
i'm losing control of the stick.

### line 2460 ###
murph? murph, come on!

### line 2461 ###
eject. eject.

### line 2462 ###
eject.

### line 2463 ###
eject.

### line 2464 ###
eject.

### line 2465 ###
eject.

### line 2466 ###
murph.

### line 2467 ###
murph! murph! murph!

### line 2468 ###
murph!

### line 2469 ###
no, no, no!

### line 2470 ###
murph!

### line 2471 ###
murph!

### line 2472 ###
no! no!

### line 2473 ###
if you're leaving, just go.

### line 2474 ###
no, no. no.

### line 2475 ###
no, don't go. don't go, you idiot.

### line 2476 ###
don't go!

### line 2477 ###
morse. morse.

### line 2478 ###
morse.

### line 2479 ###
dot. dot.

### line 2480 ###
s.

### line 2481 ###
t.

### line 2482 ###
a.

### line 2483 ###
dash!

### line 2484 ###
dash! dash!

### line 2485 ###
murph!

### line 2486 ###
murph, we don't have time for this!

### line 2487 ###
come on!

### line 2488 ###
y.

### line 2489 ###
"stay!"

### line 2490 ###
come on. come on, murph. come on!

### line 2491 ###
what's it say? what's it say, murph?

### line 2492 ###
what's it say?

### line 2493 ###
"stay."

### line 2494 ###
tell him, murph.

### line 2495 ###
make him stay.

### line 2496 ###
make him stay, murph.

### line 2497 ###
make him stay, murph.

### line 2498 ###
don't let me leave, murph!

### line 2499 ###
don't let me leave, murph!

### line 2500 ###
no! no! no!

### line 2501 ###
it was you.

### line 2502 ###
you were my ghost.

### line 2503 ###
cooper. cooper. come in, cooper.

### line 2504 ###
- tars?

### line 2505 ###
- roger that.

### line 2506 ###
- you survived.

### line 2507 ###
- somewhere...

### line 2508 ###
in their fifth dimension.

### line 2509 ###
they saved us.

### line 2510 ###
yeah? who the hell is "they"?

### line 2511 ###
and just why would they want to help us?

### line 2512 ###
i don't know, but they constructed

### line 2513 ###
this three-dimensional space...

### line 2514 ###
inside their five-dimensional reality

### line 2515 ###
to allow you to understand it.

### line 2516 ###
yeah, that ain't working.

### line 2517 ###
yes, it is.

### line 2518 ###
you've seen that time is represented here

### line 2519 ###
as a physical dimension.

### line 2520 ###
you have worked out that you can exert

### line 2521 ###
a force across space-time.

### line 2522 ###
gravity to send a message.

### line 2523 ###
affirmative.

### line 2524 ###
gravity...

### line 2525 ###
can cross the dimensions,

### line 2526 ###
including time.

### line 2527 ###
apparently.

### line 2528 ###
do you have the quantum data?

### line 2529 ###
roger. i have it.

### line 2530 ###
i am transmitting it on all wavelengths,

### line 2531 ###
but nothing is getting out, cooper.

### line 2532 ###
i can do this. i can do this.

### line 2533 ###
but such complicated data to a child?

### line 2534 ###
not just any child.

### line 2535 ###
what else?

### line 2536 ###
oh, come on, dad.

### line 2537 ###
murph, the fire's out! come on!

### line 2538 ###
even if you communicate it here, she won't

### line 2539 ###
understand its significance for years.

### line 2540 ###
i get that, tars.

### line 2541 ###
but we've got to figure something out or

### line 2542 ###
the people on earth are gonna die. think!

### line 2543 ###
cooper...

### line 2544 ###
they didn't bring us here

### line 2545 ###
to change the past.

### line 2546 ###
say that again.

### line 2547 ###
they didn't bring us

### line 2548 ###
here to change the past.

### line 2549 ###
no, they didn't bring us here at all.

### line 2550 ###
we brought ourselves.

### line 2551 ###
tars, give me the coordinates

### line 2552 ###
for nasa in binary.

### line 2553 ###
in binary. roger. feeding data.

### line 2554 ###
"it's not a ghost."

### line 2555 ###
"it's gravity."

### line 2556 ###
don't you get it yet, tars?

### line 2557 ###
i brought myself here!

### line 2558 ###
we're here to communicate

### line 2559 ###
with the three-dimensional world.

### line 2560 ###
we're the bridge!

### line 2561 ###
i thought they chose me.

### line 2562 ###
- but they didn't choose me, they chose her.

### line 2563 ###
for what, cooper?

### line 2564 ###
to save the world.

### line 2565 ###
all of this is one little girl's bedroom.

### line 2566 ###
every moment.

### line 2567 ###
it's infinitely complex.

### line 2568 ###
they have access to infinite time and

### line 2569 ###
space, but they're not bound by anything!

### line 2570 ###
they can't find a specific place in time.

### line 2571 ###
they can't communicate.

### line 2572 ###
that's why i'm here.

### line 2573 ###
i'm gonna find a way to tell murph...

### line 2574 ###
just like i found this moment.

### line 2575 ###
- how, cooper?

### line 2576 ###
- love, tars, love.

### line 2577 ###
it's just like brand said.

### line 2578 ###
my connection with

### line 2579 ###
murph, it is quantifiable.

### line 2580 ###
it's the key!

### line 2581 ###
what are we here to do?

### line 2582 ###
find how to tell her.

### line 2583 ###
the watch.

### line 2584 ###
the watch.

### line 2585 ###
that's it.

### line 2586 ###
we code the data into the movement

### line 2587 ###
of the second hand.

### line 2588 ###
tars, translate the data into morse

### line 2589 ###
and feed it to me.

### line 2590 ###
translating data to morse.

### line 2591 ###
cooper, what if she never came back for it?

### line 2592 ###
she will. she will.

### line 2593 ###
murph, i can see his car!

### line 2594 ###
he's coming, murph!

### line 2595 ###
okay. i'm coming down.

### line 2596 ###
how do you know?

### line 2597 ###
because i gave it to her.

### line 2598 ###
roger. morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

### line 2599 ###
dot-dot...

### line 2600 ###
dash-dot.

### line 2601 ###
dot-dash-dot-dot.

### line 2602 ###
dot-dash-dot-dot.

### line 2603 ###
dash-dash-dash.

### line 2604 ###
dash, dash, dash.

### line 2605 ###
he came back!

### line 2606 ###
it was him all the time!

### line 2607 ###
i didn't know. it was him!

### line 2608 ###
dad's gonna save us.

### line 2609 ###
eureka!

### line 2610 ###
it's traditional.

### line 2611 ###
eureka!

### line 2612 ###
did it work?

### line 2613 ###
i think it might have.

### line 2614 ###
how do you know?

### line 2615 ###
because the bulk beings

### line 2616 ###
are closing the tesseract.

### line 2617 ###
don't you get it yet, tars?

### line 2618 ###
they're not "beings."

### line 2619 ###
they're us.

### line 2620 ###
what i've been doing for murph,

### line 2621 ###
they're doing for me.

### line 2622 ###
for all of us.

### line 2623 ###
cooper, people couldn't build this.

### line 2624 ###
no. no, not yet.

### line 2625 ###
but one day.

### line 2626 ###
not you and me. but people.

### line 2627 ###
a civilisation that's evolved past

### line 2628 ###
the four dimensions we know.

### line 2629 ###
what happens now?

### line 2630 ###
mr. cooper.

### line 2631 ###
all right. let's take it slow, sir.

### line 2632 ###
nice and easy, mr. cooper.

### line 2633 ###
remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.

### line 2634 ###
actually, you are 124 years old.

### line 2635 ###
take it slow, sir.

### line 2636 ###
you were, uh, extremely lucky.

### line 2637 ###
the rangers found you with only minutes

### line 2638 ###
left in your oxygen supply.

### line 2639 ###
where am i?

### line 2640 ###
cooper station.

### line 2641 ###
currently orbiting saturn.

### line 2642 ###
cooper station.

### line 2643 ###
nice of you to name it after me.

### line 2644 ###
what?

### line 2645 ###
the station isn't named after you, sir.

### line 2646 ###
it's, uh, named after your daughter.

### line 2647 ###
although she's always maintained

### line 2648 ###
just how important you were.

### line 2649 ###
is she still alive?

### line 2650 ###
she'll be here in a couple weeks.

### line 2651 ###
she is far too old to be transferring

### line 2652 ###
from another station...

### line 2653 ###
but when she heard

### line 2654 ###
that you'd been found...

### line 2655 ###
well, this is, uh, murphy cooper

### line 2656 ###
we're talking about.

### line 2657 ###
yes, it is.

### line 2658 ###
we'll have you checked out of here

### line 2659 ###
in a couple days.

### line 2660 ###
i'm sure you'll be excited to see

### line 2661 ###
what's in store.

### line 2662 ###
i actually, uh, did a paper on you

### line 2663 ###
in high school.

### line 2664 ###
i know all about your life back on earth.

### line 2665 ###
oh, yeah.

### line 2666 ###
right.

### line 2667 ###
if... if you'll follow me,

### line 2668 ###
we've got a really good situation for you.

### line 2669 ###
so, uh, when i made my suggestion

### line 2670 ###
to miss cooper...

### line 2671 ###
i was delighted to hear

### line 2672 ###
that she thought it was perfect.

### line 2673 ###
it was just constant.

### line 2674 ###
just that steady blow of dirt.

### line 2675 ###
of course, i didn't speak

### line 2676 ###
to her personally.

### line 2677 ###
we always set the plate upside-down.

### line 2678 ###
glasses or cups,

### line 2679 ###
whatever it was, upside-down.

### line 2680 ###
well, my dad was a farmer.

### line 2681 ###
