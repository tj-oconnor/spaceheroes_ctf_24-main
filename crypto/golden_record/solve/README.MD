# Golden Record Solve:

I took the script from a funny scene in the movie space balls and used it to encode the flag using an iteration of the Arnold Cipher. 

## How to solve:
Use the top symbols to calculate (pythag theorem) the key to reverse the XOR on the encrypted file to get the script. 

The layout of the numbers is line.col, so 1.12 would be line 1 col 12. Use shctf{ known plaintext to guide your solution.
