'1. The 'x' array is an array of constant float values
2. The program takes input from the user, in the form of 12 float values and stores the input in the 'y' array
3. The program goes to the 'calculate' function, which takes the values of 'x', multiplies them by 2, then adds the current time in minutes modulo 12.
3a. In mathematical terms, this is (x[i] * 2) + (current_minutes % 12)
3b. Example: if the calulate function is called at 7:25, the first value would be (1.2 * 2) + (25 % 12) = 3.4
4. The values of the 'x' array are compared to user input array 'y' in the 'check' function. If both arrays are equal, win() is called. Lose() is called otherwise.
5. Win splash screen is displayed, print_flag() is called.
